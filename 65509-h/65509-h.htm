  <h2 id='ch01' class='c008'>I<br /> <br />PETERKIN PUMPERKIN</h2>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_7 c017'>I&nbsp;KNOW you have all heard of the little man who lived
inside a pumpkin. Just why he lived there I don’t exactly
remember, but I can’t imagine that he used to sleep so
comfortably inside his tiny bowl of a bed-room.</p>
<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i013.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>
<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>For, when the growly wind took to blowing over the
pumpkin patch and set the fat yellow balls of pumpkins
swaying from this side to that on their slender vines, poor
Peterkin would be jounced clear out of bed and sent spinning
round and round the circled pumpkin wall.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Ugh, ouch!” he would groan. “My poor head’s all
bumps and bruises. Ugh, ugh! Why in the name of everything
foolish did I ever come to live in a pumpkin? Why
didn’t I stay in a sensible house, and live like other folks
live? Oh, ouch!” And then, as the wind gave one last roar
and his jouncing little home gave one last, extra large somersault
on its vine, Peterkin would usually find himself
thwacked back into bed again, with his feet on the pillow and
his head buried deep in the mattress.</p>

<p class='c018'>The wind, of course, thought it the greatest fun in the
world. The wind was only a jolly playmate, after all—even
if he was a bit too rough about it. And the wind could
never understand what made Peterkin so angry in the
matter.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Whee! I love to play free and frolic! I love to send the
little leaves whirling and the dust mounds swirling, and the
heavy laden pine-boughs tossing with sighs. I love to chase
the thin gray wisps of mist and the spattering rain-drops as
they fall, and to rattle the frosted window panes. Whee!
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>I’m sure I’m more than gentle with Peterkin Pumperkin.
I always take care not to snap his anchor stem! I always
leave him fast upon his vine. Whee, whiz!”</p>

<p class='c018'>But then there came a night when myriad snowflakes were
falling over the patch. It was more than the mischievous
wind could stand. He <i>must</i> get in among those flakes! He
must make them jig and dart and dive in crooked merriment!</p>

<p class='c018'>He rushed down upon them, charging with a trumpet’s
roar. And in his wild path he rolled the clumsy pumpkins to
this side and that, until their rumble fairly shook the earth.</p>

<p class='c018'>Poor Peterkin was dozing at his tiny stove, just then—for
it was very chilly and shivery inside his Pumperkin house.
Whee! whistled the wind. Whee! it shrieked, right over his
head.</p>

<p class='c018'>Then, suddenly, the terrible thing happened! The thing
that Peterkin had feared so many years! SNAP! went the
stem of Peterkin’s Pumperkin—off the vine, out of the patch—free,
anchorless, guideless! And away and away rolled
the pumpkin house—down the bumpy field, across the ditch,
through the brook, to the top of a steep hill. Then away and
away, down, down, down, went Peterkin and his Pumperkin—over
and over in swift, dizzy tumbles. Head up, feet
down, head down, feet up—down, down, down! Then up
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>another hill. Up, up, to its top, with poor Peterkin turning
an unwilling somersault at every yard!</p>

<p class='c018'>But, oh, at the top of this hill is a precipice—and beyond
it, miles below, is the sea. Ah, what will happen now to Peterkin?
His pumpkin house reaches the edge of the precipice,
seems to linger for a short moment, then shoots far
out and down, down into the sea! It sinks beneath the waves,
then slowly bobs up again, sinks again, comes up again and
floats peacefully away with the tide.</p>

<p class='c018'>And now, with this strange happening, begin the marvellous
adventures of Peterkin in his Pumperkin! Let’s hope
that in the next of them the wind, that merry playfellow, will
try to be more gentle.</p>

<div  class='figleft id007'>
<img src='images/i017.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_7 c017'>WHEN last we heard of
Peterkin—do you remember?—he
was afloat on
the waves in his pumpkin
house. And sailing swiftly
out to sea!</p>

<p class='c018'>Peterkin, as soon as he had
gained his breath, climbed
out of the tangle of bed-clothes
and furniture which his sudden
fall had thrown over and
all about him. Then he pinched himself in every limb, and
was glad to find everything whole and sound.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Whew!” he gasped. “That <i>was</i> an escape! To think of
landing in the sea!”</p>

<p class='c018'>He pulled his little ladder out from under a tumble of pots
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>and pans and bric-a-brac and blankets, and set it up against
the wall. Then up he clambered, step by step, until he had
poked his head through the hole, in the Pumperkin’s top,
which served for a door and a window and ceiling, all at the
same time. It gave him just a glimpse of the open air and the
wide stretch of sea on every hand. Waves—blue, choppy,
hopping waves, as far as Peterkin could see ... nothing
but waves!</p>

<p class='c018'>Well, there was nothing for it but to go back into his house
and sit by the stove and begin to cry. Not that crying could
help matters any—but Peterkin was sad at all these sudden
happenings, and somehow his tears did make him feel a little
better.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Boohoo!” wept he. “It’s all the fault of the wicked wind!
One moment I was safe and dozing at home in my old pumpkin
patch; the next, here I am bobbing and lost on the face
of the ocean. The only thing I have to be thankful for is
that there’s still a warm fire in my stove. Boohoo!”</p>

<p class='c018'>And oh, the saddest part of it all is that he wept so hard,
and so many of his tears spilled down into the stove that—what
did he do but put the fire out! And soon enough his
pumpkin house grew cold and cheerless and wet with the
briny waves which came dashing in through the door-window-ceiling.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i019.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>It was a dreary party now. Peterkin felt his yellow ball
of a boat leap and fall with every wave. Everything rattled
and jingled to the see-saw motion. He grew dizzy. He
could scarcely steady himself to climb up the ladder a second
time. He could hardly see the white froth at the crests of
the waves and the deep green of their troughs. He made out
a ship passing by, miles and miles away. He screamed and
waved his coat and whistled between two fingers—did everything
he could think of to make the sailors see and save him.
But the ship sailed on and away, until the white specks of its
sails had faded from view.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>Night came on, gray and then blue, and the waves never
tired of their ceaseless jigging. Peterkin crouched on the
floor of his Pumperkin and thought of the fate which
awaited him, and worried himself into a troubled sleep.
Many times during the long, dark hours he woke up with
a start, and, through the hole in the house-top, caught a
glimpse of the stars and a smack of the salt spray. The last
time he awoke, the stars had been swallowed up in the graying
sky by a streak of glowing red, and Peterkin knew it
was the dawn.</p>

<p class='c018'>Later, when the sunshine came straggling into his shell on
the drops of glistening spray, he climbed his ladder for an
early morning peek. White mists were rolling back across
the waves, and ... oh! what was that?</p>

<p class='c018'>Not a hundred yards away, a thin fountain, shimmering
like silver, rose up out of the green of the sea and curved
down again upon it. Again it came—and again! Up, up—fifty
feet into the air, a gleaming fountain! And then, as it
came nearer and nearer, Peterkin caught the glimpse of a
black fin ... and a huge jaw!</p>

<p class='c018'>Ugh! What could it be?</p>

  <h2 id='ch03' class='c008'>III<br /> <br />PETERKIN AND THE WHALE</h2>
</div>
<div  class='figleft id007'>
<img src='images/i021.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_7 c017'>A&nbsp;WHALE! Yes, it
was a big, black,
hungry whale! And it
was drawing closer and
closer to Peterkin’s pumpkin
boat every time he
blinked.</p>

<p class='c018'>Peterkin could see its forked tail now and its great, darkly
gleaming sides. Once it disappeared completely under the
foam, and when it rose again, it was so near that Peterkin
saw its ugly little eyes and a white row of jagged teeth.
Whenever it flashed its tail and fins, there was a great churning
of water, and the Pumperkin would roll and rock so
fiercely that it almost dumped its poor owner into the ocean.</p>

<p class='c018'>The whale, I’m sure, did not know what to make of it. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>whale was used to boats, of course—but boats with sails and
pointed prows and sailors in the rigging. While here was
something round and fat, and such a golden yellow! No
bow it had, nor stern, nor sails, nor flags, nor rudder. “Is it
really and truly a boat?” thought the whale. Well, this
would have to be looked into very closely!</p>

<p class='c018'>So the big whale came puffing and fountaining up to the
little Pumperkin.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Oh, oh,” it sighed, “what a pretty thing to frisk with!
Just like a play-toy! Here’s where I have my day’s fun!”
And with that it dived deep under the pumpkin boat and
came up on the other side. “Haw, haw,” it chuckled—as
only a whale can chuckle—“what bully good sport! Just
to look at that little man who is peeking out over the side of
this yellow ball! Just to see how surprised he looks to find
me over here, where he didn’t expect me to be! Haw, haw!”
And the whale gave another frolicsome wiggle to his tail—nearly
upsetting the Pumperkin again.</p>

<p class='c018'>As for Peterkin, he was chattering with fear. He did not
know what was coming next! Perhaps the whale was about
to swallow him for breakfast. Yes, yes, it was surely up to
some mischief, was this black whale. For it had disappeared
again. Oh, what now?</p>

<p class='c018'>True, the playful whale had taken another dive under the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>bottom of the pumpkin. But it didn’t bother to come up on
the other side. It just stayed there under water, directly beneath
the Pumperkin.</p>
<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i023.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>
<p class='c018'>“Haw, I wonder what would happen if I should squirt
my fountain into the air?” thought the whale—and being a
whale, it had to take a long while to think it over. In the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>dreadful pause, Peterkin trembled so hard that his stove and
his bed and all the furniture took to rattling, too.</p>

<p class='c018'>Then, suddenly, the Pumperkin, Peterkin and all, shot
fifty feet high into the air! Up, up, like a bubble at the top
of a mighty geyser, it rose with the stream of the whale’s fountain.
For the wink of an eye, it seemed to hang there—then
down it came again—down with a spatter and splash into the
trough of the sea!</p>

<p class='c018'>Peterkin could stand it no longer. He screamed aloud—with
such a scream as the whale had never heard. It was a
scream to make every fish in the sea shudder along its fins.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Oh, dear me!” sighed the whale, “I have made an enemy.
I’ve been hurting somebody’s feelings, I fear. I should have
been very glad to make a breakfast of that little man and his
yellow bubble, if only he hadn’t minded and had acted cheerfully
about it. But now, since he’s so cross and cranky, I
shall punish him by going away and never looking at him
again. So there!”</p>

<p class='c018'>Which was just what the big whale did. And it never
could understand why the little man clapped his hands and
laughed with delight when he saw it dwindle away into the
waves of the distance.</p>

<img src='images/i025.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_7 c017'>NOW all this while poor Peterkin
had not had a single
bit to eat. Not a dry biscuit
even. And as for a whole meal,
why—that was out of the question.
For wasn’t his stove drearily
cold? And the eggs in his
basket all crushed by the many
falls his Pumperkin had taken?
And he was hungry. So
would you be, if you had gone so long without a meal—and
Peterkin, for all he lived in a pumpkin, was not so far different
from you. He sat and listened to the slap of the waves
upon the bottom of his round yellow boat and rubbed his
empty stomach mournfully.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>Suddenly, the Pumperkin gave a lurch and a fling up-ward.
Then again and again! Oh, what was it now? Another
whale? Peterkin rushed up his ladder, and ... oh,
it was <i>land</i>!</p>

<p class='c018'>Yes, directly ahead of him, the waves were combing into
a high, frothy surf thundering down upon a stretch of yellow
sands. Behind that, he could see tall trees spreading
their broad palm leaves in tufts of brightest green; and a
low hill of glistening rock, where purple flowers clung and
orange-leaved vines were twining.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Land!” cried Peterkin in rapture. “Land at last!”</p>

<p class='c018'>Sure enough, the pumpkin boat gave a last leap in the
swirl of the surf and came down on something firm and
grating. It was safe on the sands of the shore.</p>

<p class='c018'>In a jiffy Peterkin had hauled up his ladder and let it
down on the other side. Then down he climbed, waded
swiftly through the foamy edge of spume and dashed up on
the beach. Before he did another thing, he danced a jig—which
was Peterkin’s way of showing how happy and thankful
he was. So you may be sure it was a very merry jig he
danced!</p>

<p class='c018'>Then he went wisely back and pushed and pulled at his
Pumperkin until it was high and dry upon the shore. Next
he lifted his cold stove out and set it in a dark little cave of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>the rocks, where the rain might never find it in stormy
weather.</p>

<p class='c018'>“But a lot of good my stove will be to me if I cannot find
something to cook on it!” thought hungry Peterkin.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id008'>
<img src='images/i027.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c018'>So he searched the length of yellow sand. But he found
nothing there excepting a few empty shells, pink and gray,
like the glow of a pearl. He searched the mosses under the
palm trees—but only a few nuts had fallen from the tufts
overhead, and these were so hard and so bitter that the taste
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>of them puckered up his face with sour twists. He climbed
the hill of glistening stone until he could see from its summit
the tops of thousands and thousands more of just such
trees—like so many green and waving feather dusters—a
whole forestful, swaying to the horizon’s boundary.</p>

<p class='c018'>And there at last, on the tip top of the rocks, he seized
upon a handful of the purple flowers and another of the orange-leaved
vine.</p>

<p class='c018'>“If nothing else,” he planned, “I shall make a dainty salad
of flower and leaf and eat it from a plate of pearly sea-shell.”</p>

<p class='c018'>But alas! he was still to learn the evil of plucking strange
things for salads!</p>

  <h2 id='ch05' class='c008'>V<br /> <br />PETERKIN’S COOKING</h2>
</div>
<div  class='figleft id007'>
<img src='images/i029.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_7 c017'>HIS arms full of leaves
and flowers, Peterkin
hurried back to the little
black cave, where his
stove was in hiding.</p>

<p class='c018'>“This cave shall be my
kitchen,” he told himself.
“Under its shadow I shall
cook my meals and brew
my broths, and boil and
broil and bake....
Only, I quite forgot,
I have nothing to
cook. Nothing but
flowers and leaves.”</p>

<p class='c018'>He thought for a long while, and finally he decided that,
instead of having just a cold and fragrant salad, he should
heat them all up into a smoking stew. He should have a
meal to warm the cockles of his heart.</p>

<p class='c018'>But, when he had gathered the stalks of withered palm
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>leaves and had crammed them into the cindery throat of
his stove, he had to wait another little while before he could
figure out just how to make a flame. At length he remembered
having read the way to strike a spark with two pieces
of sharp rock. So
he snatched up a
pair of stones and
smashed them and
crashed them
against each other
until the fiery sparks
were darting down
into the mouth of
the stove—into the
midst of the fuel.
There was a sudden bursting into red flame, and the fire was
started!</p>

<div  class='figleft id007'>
<img src='images/i030.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c018'>Then Peterkin—clever cook that he was—laid his purple
flowers and his orange vines prettily within the cup of a sea-shell,
and sprinkled them over with salt water of the surf.
Then he laid shell and all upon the stove and waited for
results.</p>

<p class='c018'>Nor had he to wait so long. For, all in a twinkle, there
was a monstrous pouf! Great billows of smoke, brown and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>lavender, gushed up from the heart of the sea-shell and
spread themselves across the sky. There came a resounding
crackle of flames ... the whole shell, trailing its glowing
mists behind it, rose up, up, above the tree-tops, into the
clouds, and out of sight! It was gone, forever and aye.</p>

<p class='c018'>For a long while poor Peterkin could scarcely realize all
that had happened so much of a sudden. He stood staring
up at the dwindling speck of the sea-shell and wondering
... where could his meal have disappeared? And
what must he do now for another?</p>

<p class='c018'>“And I am so hungry, too,” he sighed. “Not a bite to eat
since I and my Pumperkin left the patch. Well, there’s nothing
for it but that I begin to search through the whole forest
of green palms. Perhaps I shall find a scarlet cockatoo, or a
yellow-tailed dove, to carry back with me for dinner.”</p>

<p class='c018'>But, indeed, he felt so weak from want of food that he
could scarcely stand. He lay down on the sunny stretch
of the sands and half closed his eyes. He could see, in a
blur, that the low line where the sea and the sky met, far
away, was smothered in black clouds—and that little streaks
of angry red seemed to be flashing in the black. He asked
himself, drowsily, was this a storm approaching? Was it
a hurricane, or what.... And then, before he had time to
answer himself, he fell asleep.</p>

</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_7 c017'>PETERKIN woke up
with a start. Something
was roaring in his
ears. A rushing shower
of sand stung his cheeks.
The wind was shrieking
behind him, across the low hill and in among the palm trees.
At his feet, the waves of the surf were hammering down
upon the beach in great, black, frothing mountains, until
the earth itself seemed trembling. The air was cold and
swept across his face in fresh, tossing gusts.</p>

<div id='f032'  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/f032.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic003'>
<p>“Then it grew darker than midnight”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>He jumped to his feet and ran. He was afraid of something—he
did not know what. He ran, stumbling, to the
crest of the hill. He could look out, now, across the sea
of gray waves on one side and the sea of green tree-tops on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>the other. Above him the sky was a mass of heavy, darkening
clouds, a field of clashing, rumbling shadows. Every
little while it would cleave apart, and down to the sea would
spin the forks of blinding lightning in jagged craziness.
Then all heaven and earth would mutter and roar and take
to trembling.</p>

<div  class='figleft id007'>
<img src='images/i033.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c018'>Palm leaves, torn from the trees, went
flying off, high overhead, in somersaulting
circles. Eddies of golden sand
swirled the length of the shore. The
wind, heavy with salt spray,
wailed louder and louder.</p>

<p class='c018'>Then it grew darker than
midnight. Peterkin could
see nothing now. He knelt
among the snapping, creaking
vines and buried his face against the beaten-down
flowers.</p>

<p class='c018'>The rain began. A few warm, pattering drops at first—then
a sudden heavy downpour, streaming and cold. The
vines were floating with drooping leaves upon a lake of rain,
and the little flowers disappeared completely. The beach
below was guttered with brown water.</p>

<p class='c018'>Gradually then the rain began to lessen. The clouds
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>turned a lighter gray, until they broke apart in a long, uneven
rift and showed a gap of blue. The sunshine came
through this gap in a softly beaming shaft. High against
the dark hung a curving rainbow, like an arch of jewels.</p>

<p class='c018'>The rainbow faded, the sunshine grew stronger and more
golden, the last wisps of cloud sank away in the blue of the
sky. The sea was calm now and blue. Nothing seemed
to be moving upon it excepting the tiny darts of gleaming
sunbeams. All was peace again....</p>

<p class='c018'>Only—something—far out at sea—Oh! what was it?
Something round and yellow! A tiny yellow spot, sailing
out, out toward the horizon!</p>

<p class='c018'>Peterkin looked down at the shore, his heart jumping into
his throat. Yes, alas! His Pumperkin was gone! His
pumpkin house had been swept away by the storm—swept
out to sea!</p>

<p class='c018'>Yes, his house, his boat, his darling Pumperkin was sailing
away from him—was lost and gone! Ah, what would
his fate be now?</p>

  <h2 id='ch07' class='c008'>VII<br /> <br />PETERKIN ESCAPES</h2>
</div>
<div  class='figleft id007'>
<img src='images/i035.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_7 c017'>PETERKIN was hungrier than
ever. He had lost his faithful
pumpkin, too! Oh, what could he do?
He pondered a long while. He
could try to cook some more flowers
and vines on his stove. But,
no ... he remembered what had
happened the last time he tried.
And, it seemed, there wasn’t anything
else to eat on all the shore.</p>

<p class='c018'>He must escape, then.
He must flee this lonely
beach. He must wander
away to somewhere ... he
didn’t know where—just somewhere else.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>But how? For he had no Pumperkin now. His yellow
house of a boat had been swept off on the waves, out beyond
the horizon. At last, as he stood in deep thought, a
merry idea came popping into his head. Indeed, it was
an idea so full of mad adventure
that, when it came to him,
he had to burst out laughing
and clapped his hands in glee.
For he remembered what a
comical thing had happened
at the stove an hour before.</p>

<p class='c018'>So he hastened to kindle a
roaring fire in the black iron
throat of its oven. Then he
ran this way and that on the
beach until, half sunk
in the sands, he found
a huge, pearly sea-shell.
He tore it out and carried it back and set it on the
stove. To make sure, he added a sprinkling of vines and
flowers and silver sea froth. Then he climbed up on the
top of his stove and sat himself down in the cup of the shell.
Ouch! it was hot!</p>

<div  class='figleft id007'>
<img src='images/i036.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c018'>Just as before, there was a little curl of lavender smoke,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>a little shivering and rocking—then POUF! Up went
shell and Peterkin and all!</p>

<p class='c018'>Up, up, sailing up! Peterkin, clutching madly at the
sharp sides of the shell, could feel the rush of wind against his
face. He dared not look down, but he knew that the shore
and all the wide-spread trees upon it were growing smaller
and more distant. Something gray and filmy spun over his
eyes, like a silken veil. He was in the clouds. Up, up, into
the sunny blue again, where he could see the clouds below
him now in great lazy billows. Up, up, always up!</p>

<p class='c018'>Once the fragile shell groaned, as if it would give way
into shatters and send its rider hurtling toward the hidden
earth. Once it bumped against the great black, cindery
side of a dead star and nearly turned topsy-turvy. Once its
pearly lining cracked dangerously under the heated blaze
of the nearby sun.</p>

<p class='c018'>Now the flying shell and its rider were floating forward.
And down, too. Down in a slow, curving line of grace—slowly,
slowly down and forward, through the clouds and
below them. Peterkin could see the high hills of a strange
country now—a country where all the fields were yellow
with grain, set in quaint squares like a checker board, and
all the hills were soft with the green of pines. A silver
thread of a river ran through the middle of the valley, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>Peterkin could make out now the twinkling red roofs of
cottages. It was the most peaceful scene he had ever come
upon.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Oh, how I wish I were there!” he sighed.</p>

<p class='c018'>Which no sooner uttered than down dived his sea-shell
straight upon the soft breast of a yellow haystack. Deep into
the hay it landed, with never a bump or a scrape. Peterkin
was safe in the valley.</p>

  <h2 id='ch08' class='c008'>VIII<br /> <br />PETERKIN IN THE VALLEY</h2>
</div>
<div  class='figleft id007'>
<img src='images/i039.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_7 c017'>AN old farmer came hobbling
out of his house,
along the little path that ran to
the edge of the haystack. His
mouth was wide open, and
his eyes well-nigh popped
from his head at the sight of
so strange a fellow in his
haystack.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Heigh!” cried the farmer, “what are you doing in my
stack, eh? And what’s that silly, pearly thing you have at
your side? What are you doing in this peaceful valley, eh?”</p>

<p class='c018'>“I’m flying,” replied Peterkin, climbing down to the
ground. “I’ve flown from there to here, from the earth
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>to the stars, from the moon to the sun ... and here I am,
hungry as hungry can be. So come along, old farmerman,
and feed me full of all the best things of your cupboard.”</p>

<p class='c018'>“Not I!” cried the toothless old farmer. “Not until you
tell me your whole story.”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i040.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c018'>So they sat themselves down in the shade of a blossoming
tree, and Peterkin told the tale of his adventures; of how he
had lived in the pumpkin patch, and the wind had swept
him away, in his pumpkin house, far upon the sea; and of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>the storms and the frisky whale, and the desert shore, and
the loss of Pumperkin, and of how he made his final escape
in the cup of the flying shell ... and here he was!</p>

<p class='c018'>The old farmer listened, with growing wonder. He
could only shake his head and lick his toothless gums with
his long tongue and say, “Tut, tut, what a queer affair!
Tut, tut, tut!”</p>

<p class='c018'>Then he scratched himself very long and hard, and broke
into a red-faced chuckling. It was plain to see he had just
had a new, sly thought!</p>

<p class='c018'>“I’ve never seen a shell,” said he, “because I’ve never
seen the sea. The sea is so far away from here ... it
doesn’t touch our little valley at all. The thunder of its
waves never comes to our ears, and the sting of its spray
never flicks us. Perhaps that’s why we’re called the <i>peaceful</i>
valley. We never mind anything excepting our own
business, nor care for anyone who dwells outside the boundary
of our hills. Tut, tut!” And he sighed.</p>

<p class='c018'>“And yet, for all your happy valley,” declared Peterkin,
“you seem to be sighing unhappily for something. Tell me,
what is it?”</p>

<p class='c018'>“A new set of teeth,” wept the old fellow. “That’s what
I need. I lost my old set—oh, so many years ago. And
there’s no place to find a new one in all the valley.”</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>“Ho, ho, that’s easily fixed,” laughed Peterkin. “You
shall come with me on my sea-shell, up into the sky, over
the hills, until we reach some huge and busy city. I have
no doubt of it—you may find a new set of teeth there.”</p>

<p class='c018'>Now, that was just what the old farmer was wanting.
When he heard this generous offer, he wasted no time, but
ran to sit himself on the shell.</p>

<p class='c018'>“But, ho, what about my reward?” said Peterkin. “Not
so fast, please. First you must feed me a fine meal—a meal
to take away all my two days’ hunger and to make me fat
and glad.”</p>

<p class='c018'>“Agreed!” cried the farmer.</p>

<p class='c018'>So he took the starving Peterkin into his house and set
before him a whole tableful of dishes: thick soups and red,
juicy meats and white slabs of fish from the brookside, and
frothy-leaved salads, ripening fruits ... and a whole
mountain of desserts. Peterkin did not know where to begin,
and having once begun, did not know where to end.
The result was that he ate the whole tableful, from the first
soup to the last dessert.</p>

<p class='c018'>But little did he guess what a wicked trick his appetite
had played him.</p>

</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_7 c017'>NO sooner had
Peterkin satisfied
his hunger and
wiped his mouth than
the old farmer fussed
and fidgeted to start
on their journey. Peterkin
couldn’t understand
why he was in
such a hurry—but
then Peterkin had a full set of teeth, while the farmer had
none. And it was in search of a new set that they were
going.</p>

<p class='c018'>So they sat themselves on the flying sea-shell and were off
and away.</p>

<p class='c018'>But it was strange what a creaking and groaning came
from the faithful shell. True, it went up, up, as high as
ever before; but it went so slowly and by such rickety
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>jumps and bounds, as if its wings were lamed. The old
farmer was almost jounced completely off his seat ten times.
His long gray beard was tousling over his eyes in the helter-skelter
rush of the wind. He well-nigh died of fright.</p>

<p class='c018'>Peterkin, too, was afraid. Not that he wasn’t accustomed,
by now, to this skimming through the clouds. But
something was wrong ... yes, something was certainly
wrong. His sea-shell had never acted this way before. Oh,
listen! It was groaning and grunting now, louder than
ever. Peterkin thought he could even hear a sharp cracking
of its pearly cup. Suppose that it should break!</p>

<p class='c018'>He looked down, sick at heart! Through the cloud rifts
he could see that they were passing over a great, white line
of mountain tops. Like glistening needles they seemed, as
he gazed down upon them. The sunlight glanced dazzlingly
along their snowy sides. Peterkin shuddered and
turned his eyes away.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Oh, oh, look again!” chattered the toothless old farmer.
“We are past the mountains now. We are well above a
brand-new valley, where a rushing river tumbles and froths,
and oh, look ... over there are the spires and roofs of a
city. Gray and silver they are, all gleaming and tall. And
we are flying straight toward them. Hurrah, now I shall
get me a new set of teeth!”</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>But long ere they reached the city, the sea-shell began
to crack and split, and to wabble from side to side. Once
it dipped so far that both of its passengers were almost
tossed off into the air. The farmer clung fast to Peterkin
and Peterkin to the shell—and both of them gasped in
horror.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i045.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c018'>“Oh, we are too heavy a load,” sobbed Peterkin. “I
should never have taken you along with me.”</p>

<p class='c018'>“It’s not my fault!” stormed the old fellow. “It’s you
who are so heavy. You ate and ate until you weigh more
than four fat men should weigh. ’Twas your appetite that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>will kill us both”—and he sucked his toothless gums in
rage.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Ungrateful man!” cried Peterkin. “I am risking my
life to make you happy.”</p>

<p class='c018'>“Yes,” retorted the other, “and I am losing mine because
you were so greedy!”</p>

<p class='c018'>Therewith they fell to in wrath and cuffed each other and
tore and tussled, swaying to this side and that and jouncing
up and down in mighty thwacks.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Out with you—out of the shell!” screamed the old
farmer. And with that he seized poor Peterkin under the
arms, and—for all he was so heavy—hurled him out into
the air and down, down, down....</p>

<p class='c018'>The sea-shell, lightened of the heavier part of its load,
shot up higher into the air. Then suddenly, with a noise
like the crack o’ doom, it burst into many pearly pieces.
The farmer shot down, too, as if from a gun. And down he
came close behind Peterkin ... and landed, with a fearful
splash, into a fountain in the center of the market place.</p>

<p class='c018'>As for Peterkin himself, you never could guess where
he landed.</p>

landed. Through the open

cushiony sofa. Up he
bounced again, almost to

the marble floor in a huddle. He lay there stunned and silent
for a little while, aching in every limb.</p>

<p class='c018'>A little lady stood over him when he opened his eyes.
She was peering down at him with a white and frightened
face—and Peterkin, for all his dizziness, thought he had
never seen so beautiful a maiden in the world. For her
startled eyes were blue—as blue as the sky had been, above

<img src='images/i048.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c018'>Peterkin leaped to his feet, as best he could—for he was
sore and stiff. He made a handsome bow and smiled his
prettiest smile, with his hand over his heart, as if he were
the gallant master of a dancing school. But this only made
the little lady’s eyes open the wider with surprise.</p>

<p class='c018'>“And who are you? And where do you come from?
And what do you want in the bed-chamber of her Royal
Highness, the Princess Clematis of the Four Kingdoms?”</p>

<p class='c018'>Peterkin was horrified. “Gracious me!” he stammered.
“Where is her Royal Highness Whatever-you-called-her? I
must apologize to her for bursting into her father’s palace
so suddenly. Indeed, had I been able to, I should have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>walked in very humbly by way of the kitchen door or
through the garden gate. But, don’t you see, I came so fast
that I didn’t have time to choose. So lead me to the princess
and let me beg her pardon.”</p>

<p class='c018'>The little lady rubbed one set of pink toes over the other
in a bashful fashion. Her laugh was as light as the rustle of
green vines in the spring.</p>

<p class='c018'>“You are pardoned, merry stranger,” she said. “It is I, the
Princess Clematis, who bid you welcome to the palace of
the Four Kingdoms.” Then she held out her hand.</p>

<p class='c018'>Poor Peterkin! His face grew red with flushes. He
sank to his knee—in spite of the big bruise on it—and
planted a most courteous kiss upon her rosy finger tips.
And, if the truth be told, the princess smiled a charming
“how-do-you-do,” and found it very easy to forgive him.</p>

<p class='c018'>But just at that moment, there came a loud rapping at the
door and a hubbub of angry voices and a clanking of swords
and spears against the walls.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Ho, hola!” thundered someone without. “Open the
door and let me in! I shall find whoever dares to pop into
my royal daughter’s chamber, by way of the gilded dome.
Ho, hola!”</p>

<p class='c018'>At this, the little princess ran to fling open the door.
And there, with a torch in his hand and a host of armed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>sentries behind him, stood His Majesty the King. Aye, no
less a person than the monarch of the Four Kingdoms himself.
Peterkin knew him at once by the jeweled crown
which he wore atop his night-cap.</p>

<p class='c018'>But before he could say a word, the little princess tripped
to her father’s side and commenced a sly tickling at his
nightie, just where his royal ribs ought to be. And under
his crown, the King was just a jolly old man after all. He
tried very hard to purse his lips and frown—but under such
gentle tickling, there was nothing for it but to burst into a
great roaring of laughter. He laughed, laughed—until his
eyes were wet and his sides were aching. All of which put
him in a better mood and made him look more kindly upon
his strange visitor. He clapped the frightened Peterkin
upon the back and called him a merry dog, and ended by
marching off with him, arm in arm, to the palace’s spare
bed-room to give him royal shelter for the night.</p>

<p class='c018'>Thus it was that the princess, with a little wise tickling,
saved a stranger’s life and brought much joy to the Four
Kingdoms. But you shall have all that explained another
time.</p>

</div>
<div  class='figleft id007'>
<img src='images/i051.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_7 c017'>SO Peterkin went to bed
in fine fashion. His
couch was of cushioned velvet
and his pillows of down
and silk. Over his head
were hangings of lustrous
satin, with ostrich plumes
and gilded crowns by way
of ornament. And when he
woke in the morning, several slaves were kneeling at the
bedside, ready to bathe him and dress him and to do his
slightest bidding.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Ahem!” thought Peterkin. “I must admit that, after
all, this is a better sort of thing than living in a pumpkin.”</p>

<p class='c018'>Just as soon as he was dressed in a princely robe of purple
linen with gold clasps and jeweled collar, his slaves led
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>Peterkin along a silvered hallway, where marble pillars
gleamed with wreaths of precious stones, to a hall of gold.
Here were a golden table and a host of golden chairs—and
behind each chair stood, waiting in respect, some member
of the royal court in brilliant costume. No sooner had
Peterkin stepped over the marble threshold than they set
up a loud, wild cheering and waved their silken napkins to
bid him welcome.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i052.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>He took his seat at their head, in a chair which stood
upon a golden dais. Before him, in a glowing line, were
platters of fruit, red-cheeked and orange and purple. The
smell of fragrant dishes steaming came to his nostrils and
sharpened his appetite. He seized a golden fork and
reached toward a pyramid of hot, brown muffins ... but
oh, no! He was not to eat for a little while.</p>

<p class='c018'>For, just at this moment, who should enter the dining hall
but the little princess and the King himself! The King
was in his robes of state: ermine and velvet and cloth of
gold. As for the princess, she had given up her nightie for
a gown of dainty blue on which a field of slender lilies was
embroidered in pale silk. Her golden hair was in a braid
now, with fluttering ribbons woven, like veins, amidst it.
Peterkin’s fork clattered down to the table at his first sight
of her: he had no thought of food from then on.</p>

<p class='c018'>There was a great bending of knees and bowing of heads
of the courtiers and another round of cheers and fluttered
napkins as His Majesty and his fair daughter entered. But
where do you think they sat? Why, one of them at the right
hand of Peterkin and the other at his left.</p>

<p class='c018'>There was silence for many moments, during which the
little princess lowered her blue eyes and pretended not to
see that Peterkin, in the manner of all lovers, was staring
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>eagerly at the rose of her cheeks and the bow of her little red
lips. Oh, no! the princess saw nothing—but she was blushing,
just the same.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Hold!” said the King at length as he juggled a biscuit
thoughtfully upon the end of his diamond-studded scepter.
“We shall eat no morsel or a mouthful until we have heard
your story, good stranger. So tell us it now. If it pleases
us, you shall dwell in our midst, in all the pomp and comfort
you have had this morning—and whatever you ask, for
your happiness shall be ours.” His Majesty shot a knowing
smile at his lovely daughter. “But if your tale fails to
please us, if it tells of cowardice instead of bravery, of
weakness instead of strength—why, then, good stranger,
you shall be driven out of our palace, out of the Four Kingdoms,
with a tattered coat and an empty stomach—an exile
in disgrace. So, hem your throat and purse your lips and
make a good beginning of your tale.”</p>

</div>
<div  class='figleft id007'>
<img src='images/i055.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_7 c017'>IT was an hour—a full and
hungry hour—before Peterkin
had told his tale. For
he told to the King and his
courtiers all of the
strange happenings
which had brought
him floating from the
pumpkin patch and
flying in through the
bed-room window.
And, all the while he
spoke, he could see
the shadows of wrath
grow darker on the
brow of His Majesty
and that the little princess’s red mouth drooped sorrowfully.
Peterkin faltered. He wondered what was wrong with his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>tale. How could it offend His Majesty? He went on slowly,
until he came to the fearful experience he had had, in his
flying shell, with the toothless old farmer.</p>

<p class='c018'>The King could stand it no longer. He banged his
scepter down so hard as to crack every butter-plate on the
table. Up to his feet he sprang, his eyes flashing lightning.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Yes,” he rumbled, “yes, yes, yes! I might have guessed
it! It was the arch enemy of our Four Kingdoms that you
brought into our midst. Yes, yes, the Farmer Without
Teeth! It is told in all our histories that he will work us
harm. Every witch in the land has warned me to beware
of him! And of you, too, you bothersome wayfarer! All
the ancient history books have prophesied your coming.
All of them described exactly how you would fly into my
palace by way of the roof. This is just what they say:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c019'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘Beware the daring little fellow</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Who lives within a house of yellow;</div>
      <div class='line in1'>He sails the sky in a skiff of pearl—</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Through your window he will whirl.</div>
      <div class='line in1'>He will bring what harm can do:</div>
      <div class='line in1'>He will make you endless rue.’”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c020'>When they heard this fateful rhyme, all of the courtiers
shuddered with terror. A little moan escaped from the lips
of the princess. As for Peterkin, his tongue clung to the
roof of his mouth.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>“Take him away!” ordered the King. “Away to the
dungeon with him! And send out my royal army in search
of the toothless farmer, that arch enemy of the Four Kingdoms.
Away, to the deep, black dungeon!”</p>

<p class='c018'>At once Peterkin was smothered in a great crowd of stalwart
guards who bound him in heavy chains, who lifted him
away and out of the banquet hall. The last thing he heard
was the scream of the little princess.</p>

<p class='c018'>Down, down, into the darkness of narrow cellars; down
steep stairs of crumbling stone, where the air was damp and
smelling of old mosses; down, still further down, they carried
him. At last they came to a little iron door in a wall
of black rock. There was a creaking of a rusty iron key
in its lock, and a swinging of the little door on its stiff
hinges.</p>

<p class='c018'>“In with him!” cried the guards—and they tossed poor
Peterkin, chains and all, into the furthermost corner of the
cell. Then back went the door on its hinges, and creak,
went the key in its lock. There was a faint sound of voices
and footsteps dying in the distance ... and Peterkin was
alone!</p>

<p class='c018'>A prisoner! Deep in the dark of the dungeon, he lay
with his head in his hands and sobbed to think of what a
fate had come to him. What a fine ending for his story!</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>But then he remembered how the Princess Clem had
screamed when he was snatched away—and he looked up
and smiled. There was a tiny, barred window to his cell;
and the sunlight came slanting through it in a narrow shaft,
to make a little pool of brightness on the floor.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id006'>
<img src='images/i058.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c018'>For the longest while did Peterkin lie looking at it; and
dreamed, as all true lovers do, of what a pretty sight the
princess was in her blue, lilied gown, and ribbons in her
braid!</p>

</div>
<div  class='figleft id007'>
<img src='images/i059.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_7 c017'>WHILE Peterkin lay dreaming in
the dungeon, the King and his
guards were roaming the town in search of the toothless old
farmer—that arch-enemy of the Four Kingdoms. But
though they searched until the sun was low in the red west,
they caught never a glimpse of him. He had found a secret
hiding place which none could guess.</p>

<p class='c018'>He had fallen, you remember, into the fountain of the
market place. And what a splash it was! What a wetting!</p>

<p class='c018'>Spluttering, dripping, he climbed out over the fountain’s
rim. With a trail of water streaming on the cobbled street
behind him, he shambled along into the shadow of a doorway
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>and stood there shivering and wringing his hands for
many minutes. Then he wiped the water from his eyes and
looked about him.</p>

<p class='c018'>What had become of Peterkin he did not know—nor did
he care. For Peterkin would be of no more use to him,
now that he was in the King’s city. He smiled a toothless
smile to think of how completely he had fooled that little
wayfarer. Never a hint had he given Peterkin of the
wicked harm he meant to do to the Four Kingdoms—and
of the sweet revenge that he would take! Hee, hee! and he
gnashed his gums in hate.</p>

<p class='c018'>He glanced over at the gilded dome of the palace.
Strange lights were passing back and forth behind the darkened
windows. Something had happened ... the palace
was astir! Ha, perhaps they had learned that he was come
into their city. Perhaps they were setting out at once to find
him and to pounce upon him. He had better flee somewhere
and hide!</p>

<p class='c018'>He started to step out into the street. Pit-a-pat, came
someone’s footsteps. A tall soldier, hurrying home to bed,
clanked noisily ’round the corner. The old man fled back
into the hallway, until his back hit against a door. The
soldier went by, darting a suspicious glance into the shadow.
The farmer crouched back, back, until....</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>
<img src='images/i061.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c018'>The door flew wide! He had broken it open!</p>

<p class='c018'>The soldier, at the noise, stopped and looked about him
sharply, then retraced his steps. There was nothing for it!
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>The old farmer plunged through the open door and
slammed it shut behind him.</p>

<p class='c018'>It was pitch black there. He groped and stumbled. His
knee grazed against a step. He climbed ... then another,
and another and another, until he was at the head of a steep
flight of stairs. Then another hallway, and another flight
of stairs. His hands hit upon something straight and sharp.
It was a ladder. Up this he went, too, a rung at a time,
through a narrow hole in the ceiling.</p>

<p class='c018'>A gust of wind caught him full in the face. Above him
were the stars—and he knew that he had reached the roof.
He crossed it on tiptoe, for fear of the crackle of the tiles
under foot. A broken down, tumbled chimney stopped him
at the edge. Clinging to its loosened bricks, he could peer
down into the street and over the roofs of the houses of the
neighborhood. On the other side, the lights had died away
in the palace windows—and all was dark and still. Even
the startled soldier had disappeared.</p>

<p class='c018'>He lay down at the bottom of the chimney. Slowly he
drifted off to sleep, shivering in his dampened clothes, and
mumbling strange words between his gums.</p>

<p class='c018'>All the next day he lay there, dozing in the heat of the
sun upon the open roof. Every little while he raised himself
on his elbow to look down into the street. He saw the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>soldiers marching back and forth there, so tiny in size, and
heard their faint shouts as they halted and searched each
passerby.</p>

<p class='c018'>So they were hunting for him, eh? Well, let them hunt!
He would rest here against the chimney pots until the sun
had set and the wisp of a new moon had risen ... and
then! Ah, then for mischief!</p>

<img src='images/i064.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_45_0_7 c017'>AND meanwhile Peterkin, in the
dungeon deep, was lying face
down upon the cold stone floor, trying
his brave best to shut out
from his head a thousand wild
fears and torments which
did not belong there. What
if he should stay here in
this dark cell for all his
days? What if he should
never again see the sunlight or hear the rustle of the trees?
What should he do for food? And for drink?</p>

<p class='c018'>He rose and walked up and down, up and down, across
the little floor. He scanned each wall closely. No, there
was no escape possible. The door was fast shut, and its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>iron bars firm. And the little window, through which the
day was fading quickly, was higher, by far, than he could
reach a-tiptoe. No, no escape!</p>

<p class='c018'>The sky, through the window, was a little square of red
now. Slowly it faded and grew dark. In the center of it
a single star winked into view. Evening had come. And
Peterkin must spend the night here, where the dew was
gathering in gray, cobwebby streaks upon the chilly walls.</p>

<p class='c018'>Then softly—as softly as the coming of the dew—there
was a pitter-patter of light footsteps at the end of the hall.
Someone was stealing down the mossy steps. Someone was
approaching. He seized the bars with tightening fingers.
His breath came fast. Yes, yes, it was——</p>

<p class='c018'>The princess!</p>

<p class='c018'>He could hardly see her in the darkness of the hall. He
could scarcely recognize the blue of her gown and the glint
of her golden hair. But he heard the jingle of many keys
in her hand and the creak of the lock, as she tried each key
... and failed!</p>

<p class='c018'>“Oh, this one will open it,” she whispered, each time.
“Oh, this one must!”</p>

<p class='c018'>Then, at last, she came to the last key in her hand. She
thrust it into the hole: it fitted perfectly. She turned it—snap!
The lock flew open. Peterkin hunched his back and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>pushed against the bars. He was in the hall now—and free!</p>

<p class='c018'>Neither he nor the little princess said a word for a long
moment. Then she took his hand and placed into it a little
vial of purple liquid.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i066.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c018'>“Guard this well,” she warned him. “It is the Water of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>Bounceability. Whenever you wish to leap over great
heights, you have only to sip a little of it and then to bounce
high up and away. And, alas, you have many heights to
leap ere you are back in my royal father’s favor. He is so
angry at you for having brought his arch-enemy into the
city that he has ordered your death at midnight. The hangman
is already plaiting his rope and the carpenters hammering
at a high scaffold. So follow me quickly to the
city’s edge, where none will find you.”</p>

<p class='c018'>Peterkin was close at her heels, all the dark way.
Through pitchy tunnels she led him, far under the cellars
of the city; through narrow cave-like passages, heavy with
reeking gases, until at last they came up into an open space,
where the woods came down from the slopes of black hills
to meet the streets and houses. It was the furthermost edge
of the city.</p>

<p class='c018'>“I must leave you here,” sighed the princess. “I must
return and take the spanking which awaits me. But as for
you, brave Peterkin, you have your choice: either you may
escape safely into exile and never return to see me again—or
else you may perform four mighty deeds. Aye, deeds so
great that even the King, my father, cannot do them. But if
you succeed in them, you may return here, so high in the
King’s favor that he will grant your dearest wish. Tell me,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>stranger, which will you choose?” Ah, little princess—I
wonder if she blushed when she said it!</p>

<p class='c018'>But Peterkin never wavered. “Need you ask, my Princess
Clem?” he whispered.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Then you must know,” she continued, “that there is a misery
in each of the Four Kingdoms o’er which my father
rules. Misery, sorrow and tears. Go, now, to each of these
Four Kingdoms and make its people happy. Give joy
instead of sorrow and smiles instead of tears. More than
this I cannot tell you, but go! You shall see strange things
and do brave deeds, and I shall be sitting at my palace
window, under the gilded dome, awaiting your return”——</p>

<p class='c018'>Then, all in a twinkling, the little princess had fled back
into the tunnel and was gone. Peterkin was alone.</p>

<img src='images/i069.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_7 c017'>PETERKIN turned his
face at once towards
the hazy line of hills which
loomed through the darkness.
He must escape over
their crests while night was
still here. He must take a sip—as
the Princess Clem had taught him—of
that purple liquid from the
little vial in his hand.</p>

<p class='c018'>Carefully he uncorked the bottle—and
sniffed. What a
sweet, fragrant odor! He
touched his tongue to the
rim. It was like melted candy—yet the taste of it stung
like fire. His limbs seemed to twitch and throb at the touch.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>He drew a long breath—and gulped down a gurgling
mouthful of the Water of Bounceability.</p>

<p class='c018'>Immediately he knew that he might jump—<i>must</i> jump—jump
anywhere, up into the sky, where the stars were,
and over the distant hills. He made a little run, a hop, and
then—up he went sailing far across the hilltops, down into
the valley on the other side. The whole leap took but a
moment: no more time than it takes the fluff of a withered
dandelion to fly across a lawn.</p>

<p class='c018'>Yet here he was thirty leagues or more from his starting
place, in a strange, new valley! He wondered what the
name of it could be.... It was such a wild and woody-looking
place. He could not see very much, of course, for
the stars gave little light, and the moon was but a thin,
pale crescent. But he saw that all was tangled forests here
and that wild, thorny heather and tall weeds had spread
across what should have been clean meadows. An old road
went across the heath, but it was overgrown with ferns and
brambles and ditched with great muddy pools as if no one
mended or repaired it—and no one traveled it. It was all a
vast desert of waste and decay, hid by the dark of the night.</p>

<p class='c018'>Peterkin knew how useless it would be to try to make
his way forward before morning. So he lay down under
the branches of the trees and slept.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>
<img src='images/i071.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c018'>But early the next day, before the sun was up, Peterkin
had started on his way. A difficult journey it was, too,
along the deserted road. There were puddles to wade and
vines to skip and rocky barriers to climb. There were ruts
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>where the leaves of the past autumn had buried themselves
in a soggy mass or where the summer dust had sifted into
foolish heaps. There were trunks of fallen trees across the
road, and lizards, frogs and hedge-hogs crawled or hopped
or ran beside them. All was desolate and wild. It was a
valley of mysterious decay.</p>

<p class='c018'>Then, at last, where the road slanted down to meet another
long stretch of brown heathered fields, Peterkin spied
a house. A huge, tall house, too, which must have been a
splendid mansion once upon a time. But now it was
shabby and needed paint. The bricks of its walls were losing
their mortar; the slates of the roof were falling to the
ground; none of the windows had curtains and few of them
glass. There was moss upon the steps and in the eaves.
The chimney pots were crumbled, and the lawn was high
with choking weeds.</p>

<p class='c018'>Peterkin wondered, Could anyone live here?</p>

<p class='c018'>As if in answer to his question, a little boy came around
the corner of the house. He came slowly, though he never
stopped or hesitated a moment when he was within sight of
Peterkin. He stumbled unsteadily through the weeds, with
his hands held out before him. His face was handsome,
truly—but his hair was in a fearful tousle over his eyes and
his clothes were all in rags.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>“No wonder you can’t see a thing,” laughed Peterkin.
“Take your hair out of your eyes!”</p>

<p class='c018'>The little boy stopped short at the sound of a voice. He
nodded his head sadly.</p>

<p class='c018'>“What are eyes?” he asked. “I know I have two of
them—but what use are they? Won’t you tell me,
stranger?”</p>

<p class='c018'>“Why, silly!” roared Peterkin. “Eyes are to see with!”</p>

<p class='c018'>The little boy smiled more sadly than before. “No,” he
sighed. “If you can see with your eyes, you are not of this
valley. For I am blind. And so are my father and my
mother, and all our neighbors, too. And so is everybody
in this valley. All of us are blind!”</p>

</div>
<div  class='figleft id007'>
<img src='images/i074.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_7 c017'>THE little boy led Peterkin
into the house to
meet his father and mother.
But they, like the boy, were in
rags and tatters—and blind!</p>

<p class='c018'>“You can <i>see</i>?” asked the father
in wonder, when Peterkin
had explained whence
he came. “What does
it mean to <i>see</i>? Isn’t
all the world a thing of
blackness?  Is there
anything more to it than the dark nothing of the blind?”</p>

<p class='c018'>“Oh, yes, indeed!” cried Peterkin, his own eyes filling
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>with tears of pity. “There’s the sunshine and the trees, and
all the bright flowers of the garden. There are birds of
bright plumage, and moonbeams on the surface of the water,
and the smiles on people’s faces. Oh, the world is so
full of things to see.... I could not tell you all of them.”</p>

<p class='c018'>The mother nodded. “Yes, that is just the way my father’s
father used to speak,” she said slowly. “It was in his
youth that this became the Vale of the Blind. Before that,
it was known in all the Four Kingdoms as the Vale of
Bright Eyes. But now——” Her voice sank away and
she sighed.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Tell me the story,” begged Peterkin. “Tell me how this
great misfortune came upon your grandfathers.”</p>

<p class='c018'>It was the father who answered him. “Our valley,” he
began, “was the happiest-hearted of all hereabouts fifty
years ago. These things you speak of—these colors and sunshine
which we do not know—were here in smiling plenty.
The fields were neat and trim with golden grain. The pastures
were like new-swept velvet, clean and green. The
roads were smooth and bright. The houses were all handsome,
with pretty lawns and gardens. Men wore fine
clothes and took pride in themselves and in one another.</p>

<p class='c018'>“But one day, there came into our Valley of Bright Eyes
a haggard stranger. He was the saddest being that e’er
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>trudged down over the boundary hills, my grandfather used
to tell me. He wept, the whole day long, because he had
no teeth. Think of it! he could not be happy for want of
a set of teeth!</p>

<p class='c018'>“Now, all their happiness had made my grandparents
and their neighbors a kind, soft-hearted lot. No sooner did
they see this man—who said he was a farmer—than they
took pity on him. They fed him with porridge and honey—for
they knew he could not eat what must be chewed—and
they gave him a bed of fragrant blossoms to lie on when
the night came.</p>

<p class='c018'>“But he would not sleep, at once. He got up every little
while to ask them: ‘And are you sure this Valley of Bright
Eyes is one of the Four Kingdoms, hey? Are you sure
that the King of the Four Kingdoms is its ruler, hey?’</p>

<p class='c018'>“Every time they told him ‘Yes’ he would chuckle and
mumble strange words through his toothless gums. In
the middle of the night, he arose and looked out across the
moonlit fields, where the grain was rich, and down the
gleaming road, where the handsome houses stood in sleeping
order. He laughed aloud, this time, the story goes.
Then he strode out into the road and ran and ran—faster
than ever a man had run before.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i077.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c018'>“‘I seek a set of teeth!’ he screamed as he ran. Up flew
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>the windows, all the good folk roused from bed, rushing to
see who could possibly be making such a racket. All along
his way the people stared at him. They saw him take a
torch from out of his pocket. They watched him set it
aflame. They saw him touch it, hot and sputtering, to the
tops of the fields of grain, to the hedges and trees.... <i>He</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span><i>was setting fire to their valley!</i> They rushed down, seized
him, and stamped out the fearful blaze in just the nick of
time.</p>

<p class='c018'>“As for the toothless villain, he screamed with merry
laughter when they caught him.</p>

<p class='c018'>“‘Hee, hee, my Bright Eyes!’ he cried. ‘You have been
spying on me all this while, eh? Your eyes are too bright.
You have been watching my revenge upon my enemy, the
King! Too bright, too bright! From now you shall be
blind—fast blind—you and your wives and your sons and
daughters and your neighbors. From the Vale of Bright
Eyes you shall now become the Vale of the Blind. And
yours shall henceforth be a valley of ruin and decay. Blind,
blind—and never again shall you see the gold of the day
or the silver of the moon until I come to give you back your
eyes—your bright eyes—hee, hee, hee!’</p>

<p class='c018'>“And thus he fled from us. For the dark of the blind
had come over the valley many years ago ... and there is
nothing left for us but tears.”</p>

  <h2 id='ch17' class='c008'>XVII<br /> <br />PETERKIN PROMISES</h2>
</div>
<div  class='figleft id007'>
<img src='images/i079.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_7 c017'>“AND so our valley has
gone to rack and
ruin,” concluded the blind
man.</p>

<p class='c018'>Peterkin was silent for
some minutes after he had finished. Then he shook his head
wisely, sadly.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Can you wait four days until I rescue you?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Four days?” The man, his wife and little son all burst
into a bitter laughter. “We have waited for half a century
already. We can wait a century, if only in the end we gain
our eyes again, and win revenge upon our toothless enemy.
Four days, ho, ho!”</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>“You shall have both your eyes and your revenge,” promised
the stranger. “It was only three days ago that I sped
through the air in the cup of a sea-shell, in company with
this toothless farmer. Oh, if I had only known, then!”</p>

<p class='c018'>“What? In his company? Are you a friend of his?”
The blind family rushed in about him, as if to capture him
and flay him.</p>

<p class='c018'>“No, no,” smiled Peterkin. “Not a friend at all. He
tried to throw me hundreds of feet down to the ground.
But he disappeared—and I do not know where he is. But
I shall search the whole world over till I find him. And
then—woe to him!”</p>

<p class='c018'>So saying, he put his hand on the blind man’s shoulder
and bade them all good-by. They gave him a few wild
herbs to put into his blouse for luncheon—it was all they
had for food. And then he went on his way, singing all
sorts of promises to them as he went on down the hill.</p>

<p class='c018'>As he walked along the shabby road, he came to other
houses, broken down and unpainted, all tangled in high
weeds and matted vines. Each house was poorer than the
last; each one more deserted than the other. And from each
of them trooped little groups of blind folk, groping in darkness,
to question him and to complain to him of their hard
fate. All along his way he met the sight of their tears and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>heard the sound of their weeping. But wherever he went,
Peterkin gave the same promise of happiness within four
days and left a smile of hope behind him.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i081.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c018'>At length he came to the last house of the valley. It was
high on the slope of one of the boundary mountains, almost
at the edge of the gleaming white glacier of the summit. It
was fast in the shadow of a huge, bluish ice cave, and long
icicles dripped from its eaves and glittered like jewels in
the sunshine.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>“And are you, too, blind?” he asked of the man who lived
in this high house.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Yes,” replied the old man, sorrowfully. “I am no better
than all the others in this valley, no matter how high I live
above them. I, like them, am awaiting the rescuer who shall
return my sight and bring revenge upon our toothless
enemy.”</p>

<p class='c018'>“That is just what you shall have,” promised Peterkin, “if
only you tell me what is in the next valley, on the other side
of the white mountains; and how I may reach there the
best.”</p>

<p class='c018'>“Alas,” sighed the old fellow, “those are two riddles
which I cannot answer. I only know that in that valley
beyond the ridge of the boundary, there is just as much sorrow
as there is here. There is something wrong there—though
I have never known what it is—and the great barrier
of glacier ice has hedged us from each other. So come and
rest here for to-day, and to-morrow, bright and early, you
may come upon some scheme to cross into that unknown
valley over the mountains.”</p>

<p class='c018'>So Peterkin took shelter there, in the green shadows of the
ice cave, and slept a troubled sleep until the morning.</p>

</div>
<div  class='figleft id007'>
<img src='images/i083.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_7 c017'>AS soon as dawn was
over the glacier the
next day, Peterkin was on
his feet and sipping a good
gulp from his flask of the
Water of Bounceability.
You see, he dreamed about
this magic gift of the princess’s
as he lay a-sleeping ...
and really, what an
easy thing it was to
cross the boundary
mountains, now!</p>

<p class='c018'>Just one little swallow—and then a hop, skip and jump!
Up, up and over! Over the tree-tops, over the glacier
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>itself ... then down into the valley on the other side.</p>

<p class='c018'>As he floated to the earth there, a strange hush seemed
to fall on him. It was the quiet sense of absolute stillness.
He walked forward a little way, then stopped in bewilderment.
Not a sound—not a whisper of anything. He
could not hear even the crunch of his feet upon the greensward.
He called out, but somehow his voice sank away
into nothing. The trees rustled silently; a great, frothing
brook went tumbling down through a bit of woods without
a murmur. All was quiet.</p>

<p class='c018'>A young peasant girl came toward him, leading a horse
across the fields—but Peterkin could hear neither the patter
of her feet nor the hoof-beats of the horse.</p>

<p class='c018'>“What ho!” cried he, “I must have gone suddenly deaf!
I can’t even hear myself speaking. Here, girl, tell me
what’s wrong with my ears?”</p>

<p class='c018'>The peasant maid halted her horse; she looked at Peterkin
with startled wonder. Her gaze settled on his moving
mouth—and her eyes grew larger and larger with surprise.
Suddenly she snatched a little twig from the branch of a
nearby tree, stripped it and commenced to trace queer letters
with it in the dust of the road.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Phew!” thought Peterkin. “She must be deaf herself.
It’s a good thing I went to school and learned to read and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>write!” Then he looked down at what the little girl had
traced upon the road—and this is what he read:</p>

<div  class='figleft id007'>
<img src='images/i085.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c018'>“What are you eating?”</p>

<p class='c018'>Peterkin laughed a
noiseless laugh. Then
he snatched the twig
from her and wrote in
reply:</p>

<p class='c018'>“Nothing.”</p>

<p class='c018'>“Then what makes
you move your mouth
so queer?” she asked
in writing.</p>

<p class='c018'>“I’m talking,” he scribbled back.</p>

<p class='c018'>“What does talking mean? That’s a word we know
nothing about in this valley.”</p>

<p class='c018'>“Then how do you understand one another? And why
don’t you make words with your mouth?” he traced.</p>

<p class='c018'>“We write to each other—like this. There would be no
use in talking like you do. We are all deaf.”</p>

<p class='c018'>“All of you?”</p>

<p class='c018'>“Yes, everybody in the valley.”</p>

<p class='c018'>“Oh, then this is a valley of silence,” wrote Peterkin.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Silence? What is silence?”</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>“Why, silence is when there is no noise.”</p>

<p class='c018'>“What is noise?” she scrawled.</p>

<p class='c018'>Poor Peterkin had to give it up after that. He tried to
describe to her what the wind was like when it roared in
wintry weather—or how the birds sing at evening in the
woods—or how men can understand each other’s smiles and
scowls by simple noises which they make with their mouths.
But she only shrugged her shoulders and sighed. At any
rate, Peterkin thought it was a sigh—but he could not
hear it.</p>

<p class='c018'>So he marched along at her side in strange silence, making
no noise and hearing none, until they came into the
center of a little village.</p>

<div  class='figleft id007'>
<img src='images/i087.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_7 c017'>THERE, in the silent
village, they found
a group of old men nodding
on a bench in the warm sunlight.
Across the brook a big mill wheel was turning; but
it made no roar or clatter. A cart went by, but there was no
rumble to its wheels. Down the street a blacksmith was
hammering at his ruddy forge; but there was no clang or
clatter to keep noisy company to the flying sparks. All was
silence—dreary, unbroken silence.</p>

<p class='c018'>The old men stirred when Peterkin approached. They
knew him for a stranger. They rose and made a place for
him beside them on the bench. Then one of them took a
piece of white chalk from his vest pocket, turned to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>brick wall behind him and began to write. The words he
wrote were so many that, before he was through, he had
covered the wall from top to bottom with this sad and mysterious
tale:</p>

<p class='c018'>“Once,” he wrote, “this was the Valley of the Rippling
Brooks. All were happy here, then. It was in my youth,
I remember, when in our ears there ran the murmur of a
hundred gleaming, merry brooks that cross the woods and
fields and tumble from the hills in frothy white. The music
of our laughter was like the music of these brooks—never
slowing, never saddening. We were the happiest of all the
Four Kingdoms.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Then, one spring day, when the brooks were swollen
and roaring with gladness, there came into our midst, from
I don’t know where, a strange and toothless man. He was
a farmer, like ourselves, he told us—and he was forever
muttering low words between his empty gums.”</p>

<p class='c018'>“The toothless villain again!” thought Peterkin.</p>

<p class='c018'>“We gave him shelter for the night,” continued the old
man with his writing. “But long before the moon was up,
he had stolen off to the fields where the brooks were white
in the darkness—up the steeps to where the waterfalls were
splashing into quiet pools with a cheery murmur. He
reached over the low banks, listening greedily to the music
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>of the water. He knelt, bent his face close to the gurgling
eddies—and began to drink!</p>

<p class='c018'>“We were all in bed by now and most of us asleep. It
was so easy to fall asleep in those good days, with the murmur
of the softly playing brooklets in our ears—not at all
like to-day, when night is a black stretch of silent terror.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i089.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c018'>“Suddenly, in every household, someone sat up straight
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>in bed. In every household, someone had noticed that the
sound of the water was growing fainter and fainter. First
one brook and then another seemed to die down—as if it
were suddenly drying up!</p>

<p class='c018'>“We rushed out into the village square, across the fields,
up the hills. The moon came out and showed us, gleaming
bare, the dry and empty beds of many of our beloved brooks.
Yes, nothing but dry, pebbled ruts, where no stream trickled
and no water sang. Where was the villain who had worked
this trick of tricks?</p>

<p class='c018'>“We found him soon bending down at the edge of one of
the last of our brooks. He was drinking, drinking, drinking.
He was sucking the pearly water up, up into his
puffed cheeks. He struggled to his feet as we surrounded
him; he brushed the drops from his sagging mouth and
started to run away. But he was bloated and heavy with
all the water he had gulped and he could not move. We
seized him and flung him into the water. He splashed and
puffed and staggered clumsily, dripping, back into our
midst. Hate was in his wet face, and his red gums were
like round, snapping tongs.</p>

<p class='c018'>“‘You men of the Rippling Brooks,’ he hissed, ‘your ears
are far too sharp! Your happiness is all in the ripple of
water—and I am here to take away that happiness. So if I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>cannot steal your brooks—why, then, I shall steal your ears!
From now on, I decree that you, your wives and your children
and all your neighbors shall be deaf. You shall live
henceforth in a valley of silence, where not even the whir
of a wren on wing shall come to your ears. Henceforth,
all who dwell in this valley shall be deaf—and all who enter
it shall be deaf, too—until I come again to set you free from
the spell of utter silence.’</p>

<p class='c018'>“Then the moon plunged behind a black cloud. This
toothless demon disappeared with a terrific burst of thunder.</p>

<p class='c018'>“And that was the last sound that has been heard in this
valley since he cursed us with silence and sorrow.”</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_7 c017'>PETERKIN’S next move,
when he had sipped his Water
of Bounceability and came flying
across into the next valley,
was to clap his hands over
his ears. He had been deaf
awhile ... and now that
he could hear again, all the
thousand noises of the earth
and air frightened and bewildered
him.</p>

<p class='c018'>He was wondering what
was wrong with <i>this</i> valley.
There must be <i>something</i> wrong with it, of course. And
he did not have to wait very long before he discovered.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>A group of fat and puffing people jigged into view.
Hop, hop—what could be the trouble with them? Why,
they were dancing! Hop, hop—skippetty hop, with never
a stop—puffing, panting, groaning with weariness, they
danced a crazy path toward Peterkin.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Hey, hey, stop!” cried he.</p>

<p class='c018'>“We can’t stop,” grunted the chief of them. “If you want
to talk to us, you’ll have to dance along.”</p>

<p class='c018'>Then, before he could help himself, Peterkin had a
dancing man, locked arms, on either side of him—and
he was stamping, running, tripping, jigging along with
them.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Oh, heigh, stop! Let go of me—stop, stop!” he commanded,
out of breath and red in the face.</p>

<p class='c018'>“No, that’s just what we can’t do!” sighed the fat old
chief. “We must dance on and on and on. Our legs are shot
with pain, our lungs are like hot blasts, our feet are blistered
and sore—but we cannot stop!”</p>

<p class='c018'>Peterkin stumbled and fell flat. His two guides yanked
him to his feet—then on and on in a breathless dance.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Once,” went on the hoarse and puffing chief, “we were
the happiest of all the Four Kingdoms. We were just
plain, sensible, walk-along folk. We loved to rest and doze
in the heat of the noon. We loved to lie about and let our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>fields grow of themselves with rich wheat and tasselled corn.
We were content to take our ease.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Then, one lazy noon, there came into our midst—I don’t
know whence—a toothless man.”</p>

Peterkin, remembering all that had gone before.</p>

<p class='c018'>“He was a genial farmer, it seemed to us,” continued
the breathless chief, as they whirled along the road, uphill,
downhill, in their ceaseless jig. “He lay down with us in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>the shade of the trees and looked out across our fields and
sucked his pipe through his toothless gums.</p>

<p class='c018'>“‘Ah, this is rare comfort!’ he said in a cheery voice.
‘You seem to be a happy valleyful here.’</p>

<p class='c018'>“‘Oh, aye,’ I answered him, ‘we love to take our ease.’</p>

<p class='c018'>“‘Do you love that better than all else?’ he asked me
slowly.</p>

<p class='c018'>“I stretched my arms in sleepy comfort and nodded back
with a smile. He looked at me slyly—ah, if I had only
known what villainy was behind that twinkle in his eye!
He rose slowly to his feet.</p>

<p class='c018'>“‘I shall show you all a pretty dance,’ he said, baring his
gums. ‘Just lie there in comfort—it will amuse you—yes,
and give <i>me</i> great pleasure, too!’</p>

<p class='c018'>“Then slowly, gently, he began to shuffle his feet. You
would never have thought that he could be so nimble. In
and out and round-about he pranced with fancy steps. It
was so pleasant to be lying there in the cool shade and
watching.... Then it seemed as if he were inviting us to
join him. His brawny hands were beckoning; his smile
said plainly: ‘Up, up—come along up and dance at my
side.’</p>

<p class='c018'>“First one and then the other of us struggled to his feet,
and fell into a merry, jigging step. We laughed at the fun
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>of it—not a laggard in the valley but was dancing with him.</p>

<p class='c018'>“We grew breathless and tired. We wanted to stop.
<i>But we couldn’t!</i> When the toothless man saw this, he
burst into a cruel roar of laughter:</p>

<p class='c018'>“‘You would take your ease, eh?’ he mocked. ‘You
loved more than all else to loll in the shade, eh? Well,
henceforth you shall jig and dance from noon till night and
night till noon in a never-ending wandering. Your ease is
gone—and so’s your happiness! From now on, until I
come again to free you, you shall be known as the Valley
of Dancing Legs. Hee hee!’ and he was gone.”</p>

<div  class='figleft id007'>
<img src='images/i097.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_7 c017'>THE chief of the dancing
crew had scarcely
finished his bitter story when
Peterkin swore to have revenge
on the toothless enemy—and
to rescue these poor,
tired folk in the bargain.
Then he broke from their
midst, took a long draught
from his magic bottle, and
bounced clear over into the
next valley.</p>

<p class='c018'>And the odd part of it was
that he never touched ground
there at all. Instead, he was
caught in a swirl of strong and steady breezes which kept
him aloft, floating, swimming through the air, high above
the ground.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Well,” thought Peterkin, amazed, “I wonder if this is
the fate of everyone in this valley?”</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>Yes, sure enough, a few moments later, there came floating
toward him in midair a family of children and parents
and grandparents. Behind them, in a string, floated feather
beds and kitchen tables, dishes, parlor chairs and stoves—and
a hundred and one other things of a household. It was
a home complete—but all up in the air!</p>

<p class='c018'>Then other families floated past, with little tots in flying
cradles and gray-haired patriarchs in cushioned easy chairs
with blankets tucked about them. Wheelbarrows, topsy-turvy
sheets and pillows, clothes and jugs and mugs and a
thousand other things in helter-skelter spun along behind
them in a far-away trail. Everyone, everything was up in
the air. Aye, even Peterkin!</p>

<p class='c018'>“Who are you? And what are you doing up here?” he
cried to the father of one of the families which floated past.</p>

<p class='c018'>“I’m Pater Familias,” came the answer, borne upon the
wind. “And I and my dear ones are up here because we
can’t be down below, on the ground.”</p>

<p class='c018'>“Well, why can’t you?”</p>

<p class='c018'>The Pater Familias steered his whole crew, table, bed and
pots and pans and all, toward Peterkin. “We owe all our
misery to——”</p>

<p class='c018'>“What? To the toothless villain?” interrupted Peterkin.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>The whole family groaned and the pots and pans leaped
at the mention of this evil person. “Yes, yes, the toothless
villain—the enemy of the Four Kingdoms!” wept the Pater
Familias. “If it were not for him, we should now be down
on the ground where we belong, living most sensible lives
in our homes ... and not flying from horizon to horizon
above the tree-tops. We were happiest of the Kingdoms.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id006'>
<img src='images/i099.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c018'>“But one day, when we were folk of the earth, there came
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>flying over our heads this wicked, toothless farmer—anyhow,
he told us he was a farmer. He came down into our
midst upon a grassy hill.</p>

<p class='c018'>“‘Well, what do you love more than all else in this valley?’
he asked us.</p>

<p class='c018'>“‘Ho, that’s an easy question!’ we told him. ‘We love to
keep our feet upon the ground, as all good, sensible people
should.’</p>

<p class='c018'>“He thought for a sly moment. ‘But wouldn’t you love
to fly?’ he asked us. ‘Come, hop up into the air with me—up,
up, as lightly as the birds on wing. Come, just try it—it’s
such a delightful sport, this flying!’</p>

<p class='c018'>“Then, as if in obedience to his summons, a great breeze
sprang up from out of nowhere and swept us all off our feet
and up, up—up to where he was floating. And truly, for
a few moments, it <i>was</i> delightful sport. But when we
wanted to return to earth again—why, the farmer was gone—and
there was no returning! We had been tricked into
the air and there we must remain, floating, drifting, useless,
helpless—we and our families and all our neighbors, together
with our household, tables, beds and rags and tags,
until this toothless fellow comes again to free us from his
cruel magic.”</p>

<div  class='figleft id007'>
<img src='images/i101.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_7 c017'>“AND so it is the toothless farmer
who has caused all this misery in
each of the four valleys,” mused Peterkin,
as he floated along at the side of
Pater Familias. “Well,
here’s my solemn oath on it:
I shall have revenge on him,
and force him to substitute
joy for sorrow in each of
these stricken kingdoms.”</p>

<p class='c018'>Then he bade farewell to
the People-Up-in-the-Air and floated away on the breath of
the air—away to the boundaries of their land.</p>

<p class='c018'>But it was not high mountains and snowy cliffs which
hemmed this valley from its neighbors. Instead, the land
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>below grew flatter and more yellow. Peterkin passed over
wide, misty stretches of marsh and bogs; in the distance he
could hear the faint roar of waves. Yes, he was coming
to the sea. He was drifting fast toward that golden line of
sands where the ocean met the land in a jagged, wavering
line of frothy white.</p>

<p class='c018'>He must swoop down to earth now—else he might be
carried out into midwater. He must set foot upon the
ground! But alas! try as he
would, he was still in the
Land of Up-in-the-Air—and
up in the air he must
stay!</p>

<div  class='figleft id007'>
<img src='images/i102.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c018'>Then he thought of his
precious bottle of the
Water of Bounceability.
Perhaps, if he
took a sip, he might be
able to break the spell
and to leap to the marshes below. He would try it.</p>

<p class='c018'>He took out the bottle and uncorked it. He lifted it to
his lips and let half of what remained in it gurgle down his
throat. Then down he dived, head first. Down, down—yes,
the spell was broken! Down to earth, just where the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>narrow strip of sands met the straggly marshes. He landed
with a mighty somersault, roly-poly, into the muddy bog.
He rolled over and over, crashing through the slimy rushes
and the sand, to where the waves were churning. He was
sprawling face downward, dizzy and dazed. He staggered
to his feet, looking about him mournfully.</p>

<p class='c018'>“All sea and sand and dreary marsh,” he sighed. “Over
there, lost in the blue of the sea, must be the city whence I
set out—the city of Princess Clem. Well, I shall have to
finish my bottle of Water of Bounceability now—and fly in
that direction.”</p>

<p class='c018'>So he groped in his pockets for the bottle. But oh, the
saddest of all things had happened now! He found the
bottle broken—and the water all spilled and wasted!</p>

<p class='c018'>Aye, his fall had smashed the precious vial—and there
was no more of the magic liquid left to carry him home!</p>

<p class='c018'>What now? Peterkin looked mournfully out across the
blue sea, towards where the city of the palace and the Princess
Clem must lie; then he looked back across the marsh,
where poisonous mists were gathering in low, curling
clouds; he searched the shore in vain for the trace of anything
or anybody.... No, he was alone and helpless!</p>

<p class='c018'>Ah, well, he did not know the great surprise which was
in store for him!</p>

</div>
<div  class='figleft id007'>
<img src='images/i104.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_7 c017'>AND what do you
think that surprise
was?</p>

<p class='c018'>The Pumperkin! Yes,
his old, long-lost Pumperkin!</p>

<p class='c018'>Peterkin caught his first,
golden glimpse of it as it
came up over the distant
horizon. It was floating in on the tide from the far mid-ocean.
It was dipping slowly, peacefully from one rippling
wave to the next; it came up to the shore at last, bobbing
in the surf, then pitching down with a last lurch into
the soggy marsh.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>Peterkin ran to it. Yes, there could be no doubt—it was
his beloved Pumperkin, his old home—his boat-house of a
pumpkin which had been torn away from him by the tempest
wind.... He scaled up the side and peeked in
through the ceiling window. Yes, all was as he had left it.
There was his tumbled bed in the corner, there were the
chairs, legs up. And there, sure enough, was his ladder,
with its top peeping up above the edge of the roof. All that
was missing was the cook-stove.</p>

<p class='c018'>Peterkin climbed over the edge and down the ladder.
He was safe now. He was hopeful and happy. He had
only to push and shove a little bit and—away, away he went,
bound for the home of his Princess Clem!</p>

<p class='c018'>How good it seemed to be in his pumpkin house again!
He wondered how many seas it had passed over, whither
it had wandered, where it would lead him now. For, of
course, there was no such a thing as steering these roly-poly
pumpkins: wherever it floated, Peterkin must float along!</p>

<p class='c018'>Away it sailed, over the waves, in the clutch of the lazy
tide. Away, until the marshes and the golden strand were
lost in a hazy mist. Up one wave and down the next, with
the spray dashing in through the ceiling window. How
like the first few days it all was—those first few days of the
marvellous adventures. Peterkin smiled to think of them,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>and of how many wonderful things had happened to him
since first his house was torn from his stem in the pumpkin
patch.</p>

<div  class='figleft id007'>
<img src='images/i106.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c018'>And now he was on his way to the most thrilling adventure
of them all. He was bound for the city from which he
had been banished; he was returning either to his happiness
or to his death. As he looked out across the waves, he
wondered how it would all
end; was he going to find
that toothless old villain?
Was he going to bring back
joy into the Four Kingdoms,
and a smile to the lips of
their monarch? Was he
going to win the hand of
the gracious Princess Clem?
Or, after all, would the whole search and struggle end with
his being captured and put to death? Or with the toothless
villain murdering him? Well, he swore he should put up
a hard fight.... For he knew a way to bring this cruel
enemy to his knees. At least, he thought he did!</p>

<p class='c018'>So he sat and thought it all out, while his pumpkin boat
sailed closer and closer to the other shore. Do you know
what was on that shore?</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>Why, a city, of course! The very city for which our
Peterkin so dearly yearned. The city of the golden palace—and
of the Princess Clem!</p>

<p class='c018'>And the city where he would find the toothless farmer!
Perhaps Peterkin guessed that much ... for his cheeks
grew a little white as he watched the distant spires and
golden dome, all agleam in the sunset.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_7 c017'>NOW we must return
to the toothless old
villain. Do you remember,
we left him dozing snugly
in his hiding place atop the
roof of a deserted house?
He was waiting for the gray dusk, when he might steal out
upon his wicked business. Perhaps it was the King himself
he wished to harm, this visit—but I can’t be positive of that.</p>

<p class='c018'>Anyhow, when night had come and the streets were bare
again of people and little dim lanterns were swinging in the
shadows of the balconies, the old wizard crept down the
stairs again, into the black vestibule. Then out he darted—out
into the street.</p>

<div class='ic003'>
<p>“The windows in the palace were gleaming”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>The windows in the palace, across the narrow street, were
gleaming with bright cheer and threw big yellow squares
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>of light across the cobbled gutters. The old villain, when
he stood a-tiptoe, could see the gilded walls and the jeweled
ceilings. He caught just a glimpse of a corner of the
throne itself, all in a glory of precious stones and carvings.
And once he thought he could make out the shadow of a
man all decked in royal robes—and a crown on his head.</p>

<p class='c018'>The wizard trembled and growled at this sight of his ancient
enemy. He raised his crooked finger threateningly
in the dark and snarled a terrible oath. Then he sped on,
up one gloomy, lonely alley and down the other, across wide
boulevards and empty squares, dodging into the shadows at
every sudden creak of a shutter or rustle of a tree. Once a
company of soldiers marched past him—left, right, left,
right, with weary, lagging steps. He had just time to slink
out of their way and flee into a little court-yard, darker than
the cloudy sky—blacker than black itself. He could see
nothing here. He groped, he stumbled, he felt his way
warily. Just ahead of him he heard a strange gurgling of
water, low and soft, as if from a distance. He stopped short,
bewildered.</p>

<p class='c018'>Then it seemed as if the tramp of those soldiers from
whom he was fleeing was growing louder—that they were
coming nearer and nearer. Had they discovered his whereabouts?
Were they chasing him now?</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>
<img src='images/i110.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c018'>He could not keep his toothless gums from chattering.
In fear he rushed forward in the darkness. A couple of
wild steps and—down he went! Down through a great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>sewer hole! Down, down, below the street, into the rushing,
roaring water which was sweeping through the great
brick tube of the underground sewer!</p>

<p class='c018'>Whiz! What a roar! Whiz! What a rush and dash
and smother of gurgling, thundering water! The old magician
was swept swiftly along with the stream. He sank,
rose again, coughed, sputtered, sank again. Then, as he
rose a second time, he took a long breath and lay quite still.
Yes, he was floating! He would not drown here, anyhow!</p>

<p class='c018'>As he sped along, lying on his back atop the rushing
water, with his gums tight shut and his eyes wide open to
the dark, he wondered where he was floating. Where was
this water rushing? Where did the great sewer end?</p>

<p class='c018'>Then, of a sudden, the roar of the water grew louder than
ever. He shot out, out into space—and then down, down,
into the gushing spray of a waterfall. Then down, deep
down, under the surface—and up again. He beat his hands
frantically about in the churning froth. He shook the
water from his eyes. Where had the great tube emptied
him? Where was he?</p>

<p class='c018'>Why, in the sea, to be sure—in the sea!</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_7 c017'>IT was late in the night when
Peterkin’s pumpkin boat
came riding into the city’s
calm harbor. The reflections
of the stars which had
winked up into the sky were
dotting the black water with
melted gold. Red and
green lights from the prows
of sleeping boats and piers lay glowing in the easy tide.
Not a sound—excepting the soft slap of little waves along
the bottom of the drifting Pumperkin.</p>

<p class='c018'>Peterkin, as he stood on his ladder’s top rung, looked out
across the harbor toward the huddled houses, gray and looming,
with dim lit window panes blinking through the dark.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>Over the roofs he could make out the form of the huge
dome of the palace—and he knew that there was the room
of his princess. Aye, there was Princess Clem!</p>

<p class='c018'>Could she be asleep? The hour was so late ... perhaps
her nurse had tucked her, long ago, into her warm and
comfy bed. But, no—oh, no! For, suddenly, he caught
the gleam of a little light from the window just below the
dome. Yes, he was sure it was from the princess’s window.
She must be yet awake. She must still be watching—be
waiting—for his return, as she promised she would do, and
his heart gave a great throb for joy.</p>

<p class='c018'>His Pumperkin drifted slowly in toward the shore. He
heard a strange roaring, angry and deep. It was the rush
of water he knew; perhaps some sewer, speeding its underground
course and emptying itself, at the last, into the
sea.</p>

<p class='c018'>In the midst of the rumble of water, he thought he heard
a short splash; something dark went down in the white froth
of the water, then rose to the surface near his boat—then
sank and rose again not an arm’s length away. Peterkin
peered over the edge to see what it was. He gasped and
almost shrieked; it was a man! He reached down, made
a wild grab at the floating jacket—pulled, tugged, hoisted—ouf!
and he had the drowning one inside his Pumperkin.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>He gazed down into the face of the rescued. A loud cry
escaped him. It was the Toothless Farmer!</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i114.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c018'>Yes, the toothless old villain—the arch-enemy whom he
had set out to find! And you and I know how it happened
that this old farmer came to be plunging into the sea so
suddenly and without warning.... But Peterkin didn’t!</p>

<p class='c018'>The toothless one had an unlucky time of it, didn’t he?
For here he was in the very clutches of the hero—at the
mercy of Peterkin, whom he had played so false—Peterkin,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>who had resolved revenge upon him for all the wrongs he
had done in the Four Kingdoms!</p>

<p class='c018'>No sooner did he open his eyes than he saw heroic Peterkin
above him, fists clenched and anger in his eyes.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Ow, ow,” chattered he, his red gums bobbing with fear
and chill, “don’t threaten me! Why do you clinch your
fists at me, eh? I’ve never met you before, have I?”</p>

<p class='c018'>Peterkin laughed scornfully. “What a lie! Don’t you
remember who it was who brought you into these Four
Kingdoms, not so long ago, astride of a flying shell? Don’t
you remember whom you tried to fling off, down to a crashing
death? What! don’t remember me?”</p>

<p class='c018'>The old man grew green with fright. He wrung his
thin, crooked fingers. “I—I thought—I thought you were
dead,” he moaned. “I didn’t dream of your escaping death
... dear, oh dear, I suppose you’ll kill me now, eh? Well,
just let me tell you my story, first—oh, please, let me tell it—please,
please, please!”</p>

<p class='c018'>And, of course, who could resist such pleading? Certainly
not Peterkin, who folded his arms sternly and waited
for the end of the tale.</p>

<p class='c018'>“But I had one thing of which I was more proud than all
the world: my set of teeth! A set of white, sharp, glistening
teeth! They were more splendid than the teeth of any
other nobleman at court. They were finer even than the
King’s own teeth. They were my constant pride, my dearest
joy! With them I could eat all the rarest things of the
kitchen. I could chew tin pans and pots; I could crumple
pewter kettles; I could crunch thick venison steaks and the
horns of a full grown cow. My teeth were my greatest
power—and my joy!</p>

<p class='c018'>“But all the while my heart was black against my royal
cousin. I coveted his crown, I longed for his scepter. My
jealousy grew until I could hide it no longer. I made a
journey into a far distant forest, where a famous witch lived
in her cave. And there I dwelt for many months, learning
all her wicked magic. She taught me how to curse whole
valleys of people—how to bring sorrow to hundreds. But
alas! she could not teach me how to kill my royal cousin.</p>

<p class='c018'>“‘When shall I be King?’ I asked her each morning.</p>

<p class='c018'>“And every eve, after a day of pondering over her caldron,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>she would answer: ‘When you have learned to kill
man with the joy of your life’</p>

<div  class='figcenter id006'>
<img src='images/i118.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c018'>“Then at last I understood. What could possibly be the
joy of my life excepting these, my beautiful teeth? I must
return and <i>bite</i> my royal cousin to death!</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>“I hurried back to the Four Kingdoms. I met the King
in his gilded dining hall. Before his host of cowardly
courtiers, I threw myself upon him and sought to bury my
teeth into his breast.</p>

<p class='c018'>“But ah, under his velvet robes, he was wearing a coat of
strong steel links. My teeth crunched against them—and
could go no further. I fell back dismayed. A hundred
men—courtiers and guards—were upon me, pinning me to
the marble floor.</p>

<p class='c018'>“‘Take him away!’ cried the King, my enemy. ‘Take
him away, and pull out all his teeth!’</p>

<p class='c018'>“And one by one, in the dark dungeon, they pulled out
of my gums the joy of my life—my white, my sharp, my glistening
teeth. Think of it! Think of the pain, of the deep
shame!</p>

<p class='c018'>“But I swore a deep revenge, and when I was banished,
I went to live as a simple farmer in that neighboring valley
where first you beheld me. I have spent all the rest of my
toothless, joyless days in taking terrible revenge upon this
cousin King—this royal wretch who stole my proud possessions.
I have brought sorrow into each of his Four
Kingdoms, and I shall kill him—him and his pretty daughter,
Princess Clem! Hee, hee!” He gave an evil chuckle
and gnashed his gums in hate.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>Peterkin shuddered. “And is there nothing will satisfy
you?” he pleaded.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Yes!” snapped the old man. “A new set of teeth!
Teeth as white and sharp and glistening as the set they
robbed me of. A new set of teeth—or else revenge!”</p>

<div  class='figleft id007'>
<img src='images/i121.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_7 c017'>WHILE the
toothless villain
was finishing his
cruel story, the dawn
began to flicker in the
eastern sky. And, beyond
the gray piers,
in the houses of the
city, the early risers
were already up and
stirring. Thin wisps of smoke commenced to float up out
of the houses’ chimneys to prove that cooks and housewives
were already at their ovens.</p>

<p class='c018'>The dome of the palace was beginning to flash with the
first rays of the sun. Just beneath it, the curtains of the
little princess’s window were flapping strangely. It almost
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>seemed as if she were standing behind them and peeking out
upon the city’s roofs, as far as the harbor beyond.</p>

<p class='c018'>Aye—and so she was! With her fair curls tumbling to
the clean, sweet morning breeze and her little white nightie
fluttering softly, she strained her eyes to watch the distant
harbor. Perhaps she saw something strange there—something
she had never seen before in all the Four Kingdoms.
Perhaps she had guessed it was the Pumperkin—and that in
its big yellow cup her wandering lover had drifted home
again, in triumph and in glee.</p>

<hr class='c021' />

<p class='c018'>Of course, her nurse was very shocked to find a royal
princess with her head far out of the window; but Princess
Clem never bothered to explain. She laughed and she
laughed all the while her many maids were dressing her—and
indeed they had not seen her in so happy a mood for
many a weary week.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Put on my prettiest gown,” she bade them. “Dress me
in my gown of pale blue silk—the one on which white lilies
are embroidered, tall and shimmering. And run blue ribbons
through my golden braids—ribbons as blue as my eyes,
and deck them with pearls as white as my teeth.”</p>

<p class='c018'>At that the nurse looked shocked and horrified. “Oh,
hush, Royal Highness,” whispered she. “Have you forgotten
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>no one must mention that last word in this domain?
Teeth are never spoken of here—<i>teeth</i> is a banished word!
And all because of that wicked villain——”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i123.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c018'>“Ha, ha,” broke in the princess gayly, “lots of good
things are banished from this land—and lots of good
heroes, too! But they always come sailing home again at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>the end of a hero’s task.... And as for that villain, he’ll
soon be one no longer, mark my words.”</p>

<p class='c018'>And mark her words they did, although they did not understand
one of them. Yet, inasmuch as she was a Princess
Royal, they dared not argue with her.</p>

<p class='c018'>After this came breakfast in the great gilded dining hall,
in her chair at the side of the throne, where Princess Clem
must peel her father’s orange and break his egg and—oh,
do everything a daughter ought to do, no matter whether
she be a king’s or a beggar’s child. But this morning she
did it all with such a strangely happy smile—and all in such
a furious, giggling hurry....</p>

<p class='c018'>“Bless my soul,” declared His Majesty, tilting one eyebrow
up to meet his crown, “it would almost seem as if my
little daughter had found a sweetheart, eh? Her smile is
so bright—why, I’ll wager my crown she’s in love! Ho!
I shall have to look into this.”</p>

<p class='c018'>But he did not have to! For, before he had swallowed
another mouthful, he knew the whole story!</p>

</div>
<div  class='figleft id007'>
<img src='images/i125.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_5_0_7 c017'>AYE, he knew the whole
story, did His Majesty.
For enter at that very moment a
dusty, breathless messenger—a
sailor from the wharves
which fronted on the harbor.</p>

<p class='c018'>“A ship—a strange ship is in the port, Your Majesty!”
he cried, as he knelt at the side of the table. “A ship more
strange than any we have ever seen. A ship entirely round,
with neither prow nor stern nor sails nor flag—a ship of
golden brown, and the very shape and color of a huge garden
pumpkin!”</p>

<p class='c018'>Then the King remembered the famous story which Peterkin
had told him weeks ago and he knew who had dared
to come back to his city in spite of the order of exile.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>“What?” bellowed His Majesty, his face growing purple
with rage. “This bold adventurer, this scalawag Peterkin,
back in our midst? Come sailing back in that pumpkin
boat of his, eh? Well, he shall suffer for it, I promise you.
He shall be caught and clapped back into the dungeon cell
from which he so mysteriously escaped.”</p>

<p class='c018'>At that, the little princess, at his side, blushed a very rosy
blush and hung her head, so that they could not see her tears.</p>

<p class='c018'>“I swore death to this fellow, if ever he came again into
my power,” hissed the King. “And death it shall be! Ho,
my trusty guards! Arm yourselves with ropes and heavy
chains and run to the harbor, in search of the lost prisoner.
We shall have to give him a taste of death, death, death!”</p>

<p class='c018'>Whereupon all the soldiers, all the courtiers, all the
nobles of the land, armed themselves, clattering, growling,
thundering. And down to the wharves of the harbor they
swept, leaving the gilded dining room deserted. Even the
King himself left his half eaten eggs, and forgot to clap the
cover on his dish of honey—and ran off, with his crown toppling
over one ear and his royal robes dragging in the mud,
all the way from the palace door to the planks of the piers.
Only the little Princess Clem was left, in terror and in tears.
She wept, poor thing—and made a sorry mixture of her
tears in a pitcher of cream.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>Out from the shore, in a hundred boats, dashed the King
and his cohorts. Out and around they spun, circling the
peaceful pumpkin. Then closer and closer—and always
pushing closer.</p>
<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i127.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c018'>“Heigh, wretch!” cried the King, who stood, straight and
tall, in the bow of the royal barge. “You are captured and
you cannot escape. You are surrounded by a thousand
warriors, all armed with ropes and heavy chains. You are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>a prisoner again, and death shall be your punishment!
Rush in, brave boatmen, and seize this dog of a Peterkin!”</p>

<p class='c018'>So in sped the boats, crashing against the sides of the poor
Pumperkin. Then up with ladders—up with the men,
climbing the steep, bulging sides of Peterkin’s house.
Then, one peek through the ceiling window and—what a
cry went up!</p>

<p class='c018'><i>For Peterkin was gone!</i></p>

<p class='c018'>Nothing could be found of him, no matter how hard they
searched—in every nook, behind the chairs, under the bed
and everywhere. He was gone!</p>

<hr class='c021' />

<p class='c018'>And only you and I shall know the secret of where he
disappeared. For when the dawn was breaking, Peterkin
had seized his old companion by the shoulders and had
whispered into his hairy ear:</p>

<p class='c018'>“Come, you shall have that set of teeth you crave. You
shall have the whitest teeth in all the world, if only you do
as I order. But if you do not, I shall have to punish you
as all wicked villains must be punished. So take your
choice, my toothless enemy. Will you do as I desire?”</p>

<p class='c018'>To be sure, the ugly old man could only mumble a consent
through his red gums. Whereupon Peterkin leaped
upon his shoulders and cried:</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>“Fly first with me to the Valley of the Blind!”</p>

<p class='c018'>And away they flew, leaving the Pumperkin just as the
King and his cohorts found it: empty and alone.</p>

<div  class='figleft id007'>
<img src='images/i130.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_7 c017'>I’M not sure what the old villain
thought of the scheme of flying
to the Valley of the Blind—but he
dared not disobey. For
Peterkin’s grip was firm
upon his shoulders—and
Peterkin’s breath was hot
against his cheek.</p>

<p class='c018'>So over the mountains
they flew, into the tumble-down,
joyless valley of darkness—the valley where the
toothless villain had stricken each innocent one with blindness.</p>

<p class='c018'>There, across the neglected road, at the edge of the wild
grown heath, they found the sorrowful family of those who
first had told the tale of woe to Peterkin. Their clothes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>were more wretched than ever; their house was crumbling
to the point of falling apart. And they wept bitterly when
they heard Peterkin’s voice again.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i131.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c018'>“But cheerily ho!” laughed Peterkin. “For I have
brought you another stranger—well, not exactly a stranger,
either. For, like me, he came to visit you once before. He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>brought you sorrow then—but this time he is sworn to bring
you joy. When once you have eyes to see him——”</p>

<p class='c018'>They rushed about in a close circle, surrounding the spot
whence came to them the sound of Peterkin’s voice. “Who
is he? What is his name?” they demanded in a stormy
chorus.</p>

<p class='c018'>“He is known as the toothless farmer——”</p>

<p class='c018'>At that, the hubbub swelled to a tempest of curses and
wailing. The old villain had scarcely time to fall to his
knees when the avenging blind men, groping in the dark,
clutched him, plucked at his clothes, at his hair, at his eyes.
Peterkin alone could save him from their vengeance. He
screamed aloud, as he tore them from their prey.</p>

<p class='c018'>“He has come to give you back your eyes! From now
on you will see! Aye, see everything—the sunlight and the
summer night sky, the fields, the smiles upon your little children’s
faces. Oh, do not touch him lest he keep not to his
promise!”</p>

<p class='c018'>Therewith the blind folk fell back, waiting in a hushed
and nervous circle. “Aye, we shall not touch him,” they
promised.</p>

<p class='c018'>Then the old villain, trembling and repentant, made a
hurried sign in the air—a mystic, magic sign—and the sunlight
streamed into the eyes of all the valley folk. Everyone
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>could see! Yes, could see each other—could see the
rags in which they were dressed, the ruins of the houses,
the wild heaths, the broken, rutted roads—and planned at
once to build anew a happy valley. Their eyes were returned—and
so should their laughter. Henceforth, the
years of misery and darkness should be forgotten—and
theirs should be what, long years before, it had been: The
Valley of Bright Eyes!</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i133.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c018'>Thus was the first errand done—and Peterkin smiled to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>think of what an easy, happy one it had been. And now
they must go on, over the mountain boundaries, from one
valley to the other, bringing the same gift of happiness and
hope.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Come,” he whispered to the toothless villain, “you and
I are not through yet. Now, don’t look cross and think of
rebelling—for you are in my power, and there is no escape
for you, unless you will obey my every order as nobly as
you have this first one. Besides, think of those brand-new
teeth which you shall have as a reward!”</p>

<p class='c018'>Even this was not enough to persuade the old man to go
along peacefully; he sulked and gnashed his red gums and
tried all sorts of magic tricks, but all in vain. For Peterkin’s
life was a charmed one, now that he had the love of a
Princess Royal to guard him!</p>

<p class='c018'>And, at last, when the old fellow saw that the people of
the Valley of Bright Eyes were glancing at him angrily, as
if they meant to lose their tempers after all, he took Peterkin
upon his shoulders and flew dutifully away with him, over
the boundary mountains.</p>

</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_7 c017'>IT was the Valley of the Deaf they
came to next. And presto! by a twitch
of his lean fingers and a mumbling of strange words, the
old man had given back the hearing to each of its people.</p>

<p class='c018'>What joy was theirs, now! For they could hear the song
of the birds and the chatter of their own glad voices and—oh,
yes! the laughter of the thousand brooks, which once
had played so great a part in their sad history. But all that
was over now, and they had only smiles and thanks for
Peterkin and forgiveness for the toothless villain who had
done them so much wrong.</p>

<p class='c018'>They were all listening to the chirp of a little sparrow’s
young, high in the nest, when Peterkin and his captive flew
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>away. Peterkin looked back a moment, to watch the joyous
smiles upon their faces—and he, too, was happy in their
new-found happiness.</p>

<p class='c018'>And so he and his companion came to the Valley of
Dancing Legs, where all the folk were racing hither, thither,
everywhere, and all about, in weary, dreary, jigging,
jogging flocks. Uphill, downhill, over fields and woods
they went, never halting, never resting—on, on, lungs almost
bursting and legs ready to drop off with weariness.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Halt!” cried the toothless one. And then, with a moment
or two of whispering and winking, he brought them
all to a happy halt. Poor folk! It was the first rest they
had had for so many years! They fell down, each of them,
panting, groaning, utterly motionless. Ah, they would be
happy now! Already, as their legs grew rested, they
seemed to be smiling more peacefully.... Peterkin and
his companion might go forward now into the next and last
valley. For all would be joy in this one from this time
forth.</p>

<p class='c018'>So on they flew, these rescuing two, to the Valley of Up-in-the-Air.
And only a few mystic symbols and commands,
when down came all those floating, flying people, down to
the ground they loved! And down came their beds, their
chairs and tables after them—and all was set to rights!</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>Thus, in all the Four Kingdoms did happiness succeed
grim sorrow and smiles broke through the tears. Thus was
the whole domain made joyful through the brave work of
the little stranger, Peterkin!</p>

</div>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>“Where now?” cried the old villain, rubbing his sore
shoulders. “I am tired of carrying you wherever you ordered.
My back is well-nigh broken with the load of you.”</p>

<p class='c018'>“We shall make one more flight,” said Peterkin, “and
that shall be to the window of the palace, just beneath the
gilded dome. Come, away with us—to the Royal Princess’s
window.”</p>

<p class='c018'>“But—but, oh, no!” screamed the old fellow, quaking
with fear. “That palace is in the city—don’t you understand,
in the city of my bitter enemies! And they’ll kill me
if ever they catch me there.”</p>

<p class='c018'>Peterkin laughed. “And they’ve sworn to kill me, too,”
he chuckled bravely. “But never you mind—we’re going
back anyhow.”</p>

<p class='c018'>And in spite of the old villain’s terror, Peterkin jumped
upon his shoulders and whipped him up, over the marshes
and the sea, toward the faint gray glimpse of towers and
steeples in the far distance.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_7 c017'>OH, little Princess Clem! Think

to be left alone in the deserted dining
hall, while her royal father and all his
guards rushed out to kill her
brave returning hero!</p>

<p class='c018'>She had tried so hard not to
cry—but the tears <i>would</i>
come. They flooded the table-cloth
and plates and set the omelets and
the jam pots floating. It was only
when her prying nurse came in
to fetch her that Her Little
Royal Highness could dry
her eyes.</p>

<p class='c018'>But, all day long, she walked up and down, up and down,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>in the wide Throne Room. With nervous step she marched
from one gilded corner to the other, her heart in a flutter
of fear.</p>

<p class='c018'>“But haven’t you heard?” cried the nurse. “They found
his Pumperkin—but it was empty. The poor Peterkin
must have been drowned!”</p>

<p class='c018'>That only made the princess weep the harder. Yet she
never lost hope—oh, no; she was not that sort of little lady
to lose hope! And gradually she came to realize that Peterkin
must have escaped, somehow, from his boat, and was
safe upon some new adventure. But when would he return?</p>

<p class='c018'>All day she paced the marble floors, her blue eyes lighted
with a gleam of tears. Once she stopped to look out of the
window, and she saw a great commotion at the outer gate
of the court-yard. A messenger was there, seeking admission: a
ragged, dusty man, who asked with eager face to see
the King. The little princess recognized him at once: he
was a subject of the Valley of the Blind.... Only, had he
recovered the sight of his eyes? She wondered how.</p>

<p class='c018'>And while he spoke, there came up behind him on the
road another messenger—and this one was from the Valley
of the Deaf. And then another from the Valley of the
Dancing Legs. And, lastly, one from the Valley of Up-in-the-Air.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>Why, here were messengers from each of the

<p class='c018'>Aye, true! For a little while later, the four of them had
audience with His Majesty in this very same throne room,
where the princess could hide behind a curtain of cloth of
gold, and could hear each word they said.</p>

<p class='c018'>“We are saved!” cried he of the Valley of the Blind.</p>

<p class='c018'>“And so are we!” cried he of the Valley of the Deaf.</p>

<p class='c018'>“And so are we!” cried each of the others.</p>

<p class='c018'>“And so are we!” declared the other three in chorus.</p>

<p class='c018'>“But—but I don’t understand,” stammered the King,
mopping his royal brow in wonder. “All in a day, here is
my whole domain changed from one of sorrow to one of
joy. Tell me, who has wrought this splendid change?”</p>

<p class='c018'>And with one accord they answered, “Peterkin!”</p>

<p class='c018'>His Majesty’s scepter crashed to the floor, but he took no
notice of it. He stared at them as if he thought them mad.</p>

<p class='c018'>“What? That same little scalawag of a Peterkin who
fled from our dungeon and who escaped us so neatly but
yesterday?”</p>

<p class='c018'>’Twas then that little Princess Clem came darting out
from behind her curtain, dancing and laughing roguishly.</p>

<p class='c018'>“The very same, my royal father! The very same Peterkin!
And look!” she cried, stopping short at the window,
“here he comes now!”</p>

</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_7 c017'>NO mistake, either!
For Peterkin it truly
was, coming toward the palace!
Peterkin, astride the
shoulders of his old companion,
flying through the
clouds. At first they were
only two specks, dark and
tiny; then, coming nearer,
they grew larger and larger,
until the courtiers, crowding at the windows, could see the
eager look in Peterkin’s bright eyes and could catch a
glimpse of the red gums of the old villain under him.</p>

<p class='c018'>Nearer, nearer—then swooping down from the clouds
and in at the window came the two travelers, into the midst
of those who thronged the golden throne room.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>The toothless villain ran and cowered in a corner, trembling
with fear. But Peterkin stood forth boldly, his head
thrown back with pride.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Here am I, Your Majesty!” he cried. “Here am I,
returned whence I once fled. You may thrust me back into
that pitchy dungeon—you may kill me, but——”</p>

<p class='c018'>Great cheers drowned the rest of his words. One and all,
the courtiers, the nobles, the King himself, were waving
jeweled hands and making a joyous thunder of his name.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Peterkin! Peterkin, our hero! Peterkin, our saviour!
Brave, mighty, magic Peterkin!”</p>

<p class='c018'>He fell back and rubbed his eyes. What did it all mean?
Could he be dreaming?</p>

<p class='c018'>No, for the King had risen from his throne now and was
coming down its golden steps straight toward him, with
arms outstretched.</p>

<p class='c018'>“You have swept the shadows from my domain!” he
cried. “You have brought laughter into faces which once
were bathed in tears. You have given joy for sorrow—and
joy—aye, untold joy!—shall be your reward! Ask of
me now whatever you most wish, and I promise it shall be
yours! But first of all, we must take our proper revenge
upon the villain you have so neatly brought into our
power.”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>
<img src='images/i145.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c018'>“Ah, that’s just it, Your Majesty!” interrupted Peterkin.
“Here’s my dearest wish—and surely you’ll not have the
heart to refuse it. I ask for mercy for your noble cousin,
the toothless farmer. Indeed, if only you provide him with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>a new set of teeth, I’m sure he will make a very loyal and
faithful subject evermore.”</p>

<p class='c018'>The King grew red in the face, at this reminder. But
he had given his word—and not even a king can go back
on that!</p>

<p class='c018'>“How now, my villainous cousin?” he roared, turning
to the old fellow. “Will you cease your wicked magic all
the days of your life, if I forgive you for the sake of generous
Peterkin? And, if I do provide you a new set of teeth,
will you try very hard not to bite me?”</p>

<p class='c018'>“Oh, yes—indeed, yes! I am so sick of soups and jellies:
I am longing for the crunch of a good beefsteak. And oh!
my royal cousin, what a feast I shall be able to eat if only
you give me a brand-new set of teeth! And I shall be so
proud of them I’ll do nothing more than sit in a corner and
grin the whole day long!”</p>

<p class='c018'>So, when the little princess had joined her prayer for forgiveness
to those of Peterkin and the rest of the courtiers,
the King could do naught but order his royal dentist to
appear upon the scene. And the dentist took very good
pains to make an exact measure of the mouth of the old
fellow, who went on mumbling in a most delighted way:</p>

<p class='c018'>“Hee, hee! New teeth! A brand-new set of teeth! Well,
now I am satisfied! No more villainy for me! the crunch
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>of a good beefsteak. And I shall be the happiest, most satisfied
nobleman in the land!”</p>

<p class='c018'>Which set the whole court to cheering and clapping their
hands louder than ever!</p>

</div>
<div  class='figleft id007'>
<img src='images/i148.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_7 c017'>“SO, now,” said the King, “you
shall have your true reward.”
And to make it the more impressive, he
nudged our Peterkin in the ribs
with the end of his golden scepter
and winked his royal eye at the
Princess Clem, who stood
nearby in blushing joy.</p>

<p class='c018'>Straightway the courtiers
gathered about their new
hero, lifted him high upon their shoulders and bore him
away, out of the throne room, out of the pillared halls, into
the center of that very same market square which flanked
the sunny palace. And there they cheered him, long and
loud:</p>

<p class='c018'>“All hail to Peterkin, Prince of the Realm! All hail to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>Peterkin, beloved of a Princess Royal! All hail to Peterkin,
hero of heroes and King-to-be!”</p>

<div id='f148'  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/f148.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic003'>
<p>“Where was it bound? Haven’t you guessed?”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>It was only then that modest Peterkin could guess how
great were the honors and rewards which had befallen him.
For a golden coronet they placed upon his head—and a
purple robe upon his shoulders. And a golden sword upon
a jeweled belt went ’round his waist to mark, from this time
forth, that he was chief commander of all the King’s guards.</p>

<p class='c018'>And, the very next day, at the hour of ruddy sunset, when
all the windows of the palace burned with a bright reflection,
and the moon was sailing high up, white and wan, into
the clouds, there began the celebration of the most magnificent
marriage that e’er was held or will be held in all the
Four Kingdoms. And you know well enough who were
the bride and bridegroom!</p>

<p class='c018'>The banquet which followed was so splendid an affair
that for three days thereafter the court doctor and all his
chemists were kept busy at compounding cures for indigestion.
For there were twenty different soups to taste—and
each one thicker than the other. There were fish from the
sea, the river and the brook; roast peacocks, with their tails
still spread in blue and shimmering beauty; stuffed pigs
with brown and crackling skin; all sorts of jellies, jams and
ices; bonbons heaped in silver dishes, and—ah, yes, a wedding
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>cake which towered so high that it touched the gilded
ceiling. Think what a time the princess must have had
cutting it to pieces—as all thoughtful brides do—with Peterkin’s
sharp sword!</p>

<div  class='figcenter id004'>
<img src='images/i150.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c018'>Of course, you are curious to learn how beautiful the
bride appeared. But that’s beyond my power to describe.
I can only tell you that she was more lovely than ever she
had been before; and that her golden hair was twined with
precious rubies, with a rivulet of diamonds on her forehead.
Her gown was of silver white brocade; but on it were embroidered,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>in fine gold, a complete set of pictures of the
marvelous history of her heroic husband. The Pumperkin,
the adventure with the whale, the meeting with the old
villain, the flight from the dungeon, the rescue of each of
the four joyless valleys, ... all were depicted there.
Everyone wondered, to be sure, how such a handsome work
of art could have been made so hastily—but ah, they did
not know that, in her long hours of lonely waiting, the little
Princess Clem had nearly ruined her dainty fingers with
the needle and threads of the loom. For happiness is always
born of toiling; and love grows greater for a little patient
hardship.</p>

<p class='c018'>The villainous cousin, now very peaceful, was very
proud of a set of false teeth; and munched and munched in
hungry bliss upon a plate of his favorite beefsteak. The
King, at his end of the table, smiled down upon his feasting
friends in joy and perfect bliss. Here was his whole domain
reborn into happiness and hard at work and play
again. Here was his only daughter wed to the nation’s
hero. And—this is what made him smile the broadest—here
was a chance to climb down from his royal throne,
within a year or two, and place his heavy crown on Peterkin’s
own forehead. For, if the truth must be told, the King
was growing a little tired of playing King and wearing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>velvet robes the whole day long; he longed, as old men
always do, for the comfort of his big clay pipe, his shirt
sleeves and his slippers. And here were a new King and a
Queen, all ready made, to rule his land with virtue and with
wisdom.</p>

<p class='c018'>Then, while the banquet was at its jolliest, the bride and
bridegroom stole away in a coach that was drawn by six
white steeds, and clattered down the festooned streets to the
steps of the royal wharf. And there, in the moonlit harbor,
the Pumperkin lay waiting. But oh! what a different
Pumperkin! For plates of gold were on it now, and a
hundred gay flags, and a sail of blue satin. There were
sailors to tend it, too, and a great fleet of skiffs to bear it
company across the sea.</p>

<p class='c018'>There was music on the waters and the soft and tender
strains played by the royal harpists were caught up by the
breezes and carried straight to the Pumperkin. It seemed to
sway gently up and down, up and down, as if the waves kept
time with the music.</p>

<p class='c018'>Inside his snug and comfortable boat-house, Peterkin was
telling his dear little bride the many wonderful adventures
that befell him from the time they had parted in the dungeon
to the happy hour of his return. And while they were thus
in sweet converse, the Pumperkin was gliding on....</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>Where was it bound? Haven’t you guessed? Why, for
brave Peterkin’s old home, the Pumpkin Patch! That’s
where the honeymoon would be—and then.... Then
back to the Four Kingdoms, to reign for years in peace
and power and glory.</p>

<p class='c018'>And some day, when you, too, have grown up and have
wed a Princess Clem, and have come into a kingdom of
your own, you will live—as they lived—happily ever after.</p>

notch or so, you will not yet have mislaid the key to your Imagination, and you will see—as
probably your elders will not be able to do clearly—that this book has the familiar look in its
pages of the places you know so well when you are asleep or just dozing before the fire. Some
people write stories for children which remind one of the man on the city roof-top looking through
the skylight at what the people are doing in the room below. But Gilly Bear, when he wrote
these stories, sat at the desk within the room and possessed himself of an intimate knowledge
of all that happened there. The entire book deals with Bobby and a funny old elf, evidently
numberless hundreds of years old, who lures the former to Slumberland every night. The old
elf is vividly portrayed by Helen E. Ohrenschall, to whom the author is indebted for the delightful
pictorial features of the book.”—<i>The New York Evening Sun.</i></p>

<p class='c018'>“Saml. Gabriel Sons &amp; Company have recently published three attractively bound children’s
books for the holiday season, written by Gilly Bear. ‘<span class='sc'>Tom Tit Tales</span>’ tells of a most
convenient fairy, who comes to comfort children at Tired-time—Bobby is delightfully entertained
by Tom Tit and is taken on most fascinating excursions into Candy Land, to the Clock
in the Sky, to the Rainbow and other equally interesting places, if he has been good all day.
The illustrations in color are by Helen E. Ohrenschall.”—<i>News Press, St. Joseph.</i></p>

The illustrations done by Frances Brundage are in themselves ample commendation for this
charming book for the Christmas list. The world of fairyland is put under tribute to furnish
the theme. Holland is made the setting and the talented co-workers in author and artist offer
one of the most pleasing numbers in the Gilly Bear series, as a result of their deft workmanship.
There is a world of diversion in following the fortunes of Katrina and Jan in sailing down ‘the

is a fairy tale built around the adventures of two little Dutch children in search of a fairy tulip.

agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few

Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
